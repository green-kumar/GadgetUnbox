Micromax X610,1 stars,"It's actually sensible, to avoid this !","Most pathetic thing about these new lot of Micromax feature phones are : -- Firstly, all these budget devices carry only 6 months warranty instead of 1 year warranty. So, beware ! -- Secondly, none of them has a charger & headset provided in the sales package. Most of the customers (post-purchase) are literally feeling duped with this kind of weird changes from what all are used to, since inception of mobile phones. I mean, what kind of cost-cutting is this ? Simply unjustified & highly disgusting ! 3 users found this review helpful helpful?","18 Oct 2015,"

Lenovo A2010,4 stars,My 1st Lenovo Phone,"Thanks Flipkart for early delivery!!! Looks wise its great. Light Weight. Display is good, It comes along with screen guard. Can operate using one hand easily. Earphones are present in the box, don't worry... Removable battery. Charger cum USB, but its not long enough! Camera is OK.. Still good at this price with torch. After getting this, you will have to upgrade it immediately for smooth functioning. It takes some time.

Micromax X601,5 stars,I like it.....,Really amazing phone in this range. If you are going for looks than it is little bit different from images . keys areas are totally different from image shown on website. And also on this phone box rate of this phone is Rs.1199 but I buy it @ Rs.1189. I hope it is little bit high. But this phone is very good for old people or who want to use it only for calling. Camera is basic not good just showing. Good point is dual stand by Sim .overally if you want a phone in between Rs.1000 to Rs.1500 then I suggest this phone. 1 users found this review helpful helpful?,"09 May 2016,"

Lava Flair P1i,1 stars,Worst Product,"Every Phone with 256 ROM and 512 RAM is just shit. I don't know that why these companies make these kind of products. May be to fool the consumers, that they are providing the high technology at such a low price. What about the configuration, If you are making a smartphones then make it better for low price. What will do a person with 256 ROM and 512 RAM. Today only Facebook app needs a memory up to 100 MB. Who will give this answer. This product is just a shame for the company. 1 users found this review helpful helpful?","01 Sep 2015,"
Lava Flair P1i,4 stars,Worth less Product,"I read online that the Lava Flair P1i comes with a 1 GHz processor and 256 MB RAM, which means that this phone will be able to handle multi-tasking with ease.

Karbonn Titanium S109,1 stars,Filed Consumer complaint against Karbonn Mobile.,"Dear friends Karbonn Mobile is the worst company in India. Such companies should be banned in our country. Don't buy anything from it. All the phones are of bad quality. I had purchased Titanium S3 2 years back after referred by two friends. My phone starts giving trouble on 5th day. I tried to resolve my problem with buyer ( Reliance Digital Korum Mall) and service center. But all invain. On 15th day my phone got switched off. I submitted this phone to service centre. After too many follow ups they didn't do anything. I had already filed consumer complaint. But 2years now still no result. You think yourself before buying karbonn products, what do you want to buy, mobile phone or consumer court. 1 users found this review helpful helpful?","04 Oct 2015,"

Panasonic Eluga Icon do have some cool specs..a big 3500mAh Battery.. but it is still running on Android Kitkat. This has identical specs to the Alcatel Flash Plus. I wouldn't be surprised if this is just a rebranded version of the same. Edit : This post was made when there was plenty of 5 Star Reviews when the device wasn't even in Stock.

Asus Zenfone Max ZC550KL,5 stars,Asus hits the Sweet spot! Ideal companion for everyone,"Zenfone Max is true to its name. # Build quality: 10/10 Top notch # Battery longevity : 10/10 2 days backup on very heavy usage. In fact it can serve as power bank for other devices in case the need be. # Display : 9/10 Crisp and accurate. Ideal for reading mails or e-books or movies. # Zen UI : 9/10 One of the best custom android UI out there. Quite amendable to one's tastes. # Touch responsivess : 10/10 Absolutely spot on # Processor : 8/10 Not the best processor but ideal for normal users. Almost lacking any lag or delay in day to day use. # Heating issue : 10/10 No heating at all. Mi users please take note this is simply in an another league. Mi phones though serve the unintended purpose of heater in winters. # Value for money : 10/10 Absolute gem for the 9999 price paid. No premium being paid for the powerhouse inside. About Asus : NOT CHINESE, it is a TAIWANESE multinational brand who holds the expertise in computing since years. And are well placed and here to stay for years. Service centers are easily available in most nooks and corners of the country. 5000 mAh battery is class leading and it doesnt make the device as bulky as one one would expect. In fact, owing to nice weight distribution, it doesnt feel that heavy to hold. DJ's VERDICT: 9/10 You would love to own one and they way it holds on charge for a long period, it is an ideal PARTNER IN CRIME for many. ------------------- Please Hit Like to encourage DJ. :) read more ? 73 users found this review helpful helpful?","14 Jan 2016,"

Asus Zenfone Selfie 32GB,5 stars,Great buy in midrange price.....,"I will first answer some of the misconceptions about phone which are given in some reviews - 1) We can put 2 sims AND a sd card.. It doesnt have hybrid sim as pointed out by some. Remove the battery and you will notice that the slot has 2 compartments, one for sim and other for SD card. And Another sim card slot is clearly visible on right side of back. 2) Many said that camera is not upto the mark, but I think they just know how to press click button only. There are many options for clicking pictures in many scenario. Camera is really good considering the price. What were you expecting?? DSLR type pics... Mobile camera doesn't have much manual control and many things like OIS are only provided in high end mobiles. Believe me, camera of this mobile is very very good. You will notice the difference if you will compare pics by other mobiles in the same price range. 3) Some are even saying that there is no charger in the box. You can see charger lying in the box. Why people are giving absurd reviews. Now, here's the review of this mobile - Display - display is awesome. Also gorilla glass 4 is provided. No need of using screen guard and making the screen look dull. Also fingerprints proof because of oleophobic coating. Front Camera - Front camera is really good. It is 13mp but pics will not look like as if they are taken from 13mp mobile camera. But the pics you get from the front camera of this mobile are really great. They are not like the 5mp type of other mobiles. You will really love the front camera. Quality is really great and even dual tone flash is provided in front camera. If you take too much pics with front camera then strictly speaking, buy this mobile. Period. Rear camera - It is 13mp with dual tone flash (don't confuse dual tone with 2 led flash) and some features like laser focus are not found in other mobiles below 20,000. Now, point and click will give you nice pictures but if you want quality pictures than use the manual control and many features like in depth pic, manual mode and others. Some features are really awesome like if you are taking pic in a busy place and someone passes from front of you than there is a option which remove these type of things and there are many features like this. Don't expect pictures to be like as they come in DSLR. If mobiles were able to take that kind of quality pics then why people will buy DSLR. Mobile camera is not for professional photography but only to do the job of capturing some epic moments in life. RAM - you will get at max like 2100 mb free and there will always be like 700mb free even if you open many apps. So to use whole of the free ram, you have to open many apps and rarely someone opens more than 10 apps simultaneously. Ram will not cause any issue unlike my last samsung mobile. ZEN UI - I personally don't like the look of zen ui and also not in the mood of installing other launchers. But you can make zen ui look great by making few changes in the settings and downloading some good icon pack. Now, my ui is looking completely differenet as comapred to what factory settings provided. Battery - Now, this is where mobile let you down. Considering full hd display and a very nice processor, it was expected that battery consumption will be more. In standby mode, battery will hardly show any sign of depletion. In my case, battery went down to 2% only in 2.5 hours in stand by mode but while using things like wifi and others, consumption will be fast. But ultra saving mode is also provided by asus. And, I was using mobile in 90% brightness, if you will lower it then it may last long. I think on an average it will last 18-24 hours considering you use it normally. Also charging the battery takes time, it is where asus let this mobile down. But, even moto play battery is down in a day considering they provided 3650 mah battery. So, better option is Asus, I think. Processor - you can search about the snapdragon 615 processor in google, Period. Internal space - you will get 22-23gb free space from 32 gb provided. Build factor - I personally like the volume buttons on back and it doesnt feel like cheap mobile. Few cons - 1) You will not feel the lag anywhere expect while viewing photos after clicking them. Mobile takes some time processing it. 2) Battery may be a problem for some but not for normal user. Few Pros - 1) Front camera is really really awesome. 2) Display + Gorilla Glass 4 + Oleophobic coating. Period. read more ? 32 users found this review helpful helpful?","16 Sep 2015,"

Asus Zenfone 2 Deluxe,4 stars,Actual review after handling 48 hr,"1) Thanks flipkart, you were awesome in terms of delivering. Surprise in 2 days I got 2) This phone is overall good, but I am not sure they are not including headphone, is this missing or they don't provide. Please verify this 3)zenUI have worked really good in providing some best features. 4)Camera is not so bad, as in many review they mentioned. 5)As android have problem enabling everything like auto sync and blah blah. At first you need to configure those for getting a good battery backup. 6) Yes battery drains bit first, but on other hand it charge nearly 65 % in 20 min. 7)I feel this phone is bit bulky in hand, may be I was using iPhone 4, that was too small. 8)It handles multitasking very well. 9) Best part no need to worry about storage, it connects to otg, sd card. 10)using asus pclink, u can easily sync your mobile screen on PC, asus have provided their own apps which are really very useful. 11) I have notice this phone get heated up, when you do any long installation or running any game, which is a negative point. Overall 85/100... within this price range it is good. 6 users found this review helpful helpful?","31 Aug 2015,"

Karbonn Titanium MachFive,4 stars,Ordered itReceived it Used it for a dayReviewed it.,"i was eagerly waiting for device to come in stock.And when it did...Ordered it-Received it- Used it for a day-Reviewed it. Lets not waste your time..... ---------------------------------------------------- +KEY FINDINGS ( PROS+CONS ) ---------------------------------------------------- Good to see IR blasters in such a cheap device. -Works pretty good as a usual remote controller. The entire handset is plastic built.The design is not top notch but still it looks and feels good in hands. Considering the price point i would say its more than what you pay for. The ear piece on the front has metallic protection.Sound quality through it is satisfactory. The front and back shooter are equipped with flash. The sound quality from the main speaker is good as seen in other quality phones.Its very loud and didn't notice muffling . The navigation buttons are well placed and are pretty responsive. -They are backlit display is bright and vibrant .Yes it is HD but the viewing angles are on the below average side.As said you could get better display at the same price point. Comes with lollipop installed so you are getting almost the latest from android as of now(5.0...not 5.1).The UI is decent as stock ones. Karbonn has done a great job in keeping the OS clean,without loading it with much of the unnecessary bloatware. Out of 16gb an approx. of 11 Gb is user available.And out of 2GB RAM 1.45 gb is free. which again is a good thing. It is well equipped with a decent version of mediatech CPU.which is a quad core one. It Handles the device well,didn't see any lag in normal usage or app switching and all. The glass on the front is very reflective and also fingerprint magnet.(tempered glass recommended) . both the camera seems to perform really good.The images are sharp and well saturated.Takes the pic real quick. Battery also is doing a decent job.No quick battery drain issues as of yet as i have noticed in some other devices in the same price range.I guess it will last a day and so for a normal user. didn't play much of the games expect temple run and some of the light games.As usual it did handle those really easily. no heating as of a normal usage nor when i payed light games.Will update about that later after playing some heavy ones. Surely,This device is not a beast in performance but considering the price and the specification it offers i guess its a great value for money.I have no regrets buying this device. will recommend to those who need decent camera with great selfie,decent day to day performance,good sound output, good battery life,least bloatware and comparatively decent after sales support. ----------------------- One Last Thing Just in case if you like my review then please click on the 'YES' button below. read more ? 507 users found this review helpful helpful?","08 Aug 2015,"

Karbonn Titanium MachFive,1 stars,Biggest mistake to Buy a KARBONN mobile,"The phone provided to me was a defective piece. It was delivered to me on 21-01-2016. However on 14-Feb-2016 (Not even 1 month), the screen would not turn on. On 15-Feb-2016 the phone was submitted to Techno Care (Authorised Karbonn Service centre in Kolkata). Till date (11-04-2016) (almost 2 months) the only reply i get from service centre is "" Call the head office"", "" Our system does not show the exact status of the phone"". The head office says the phone is at the repairing centre the location of which for some reason they cannot disclose. Ive been told that multiple parts are not working and hence need those parts need to be replaced. If that does not work then the motherboard will have to be changed & currently their parts are out of stock. Worst customer service i have ever seen. Biggest mistake of my life to purchase a Karbonn product. Im not sure if Amazon is also to be blamed cause i have never had an issue with amazon untill i madel this purchase. 100 users found this review helpful helpful?","11 Apr 2016,"

Intex Aqua Trend,2 stars,Claims of Features seem suspicious,"Just got Intex Aqua Trend (Champagne) delivered in the evening... Delivery was prompt, packing was good. NOTE: bought it as a proud indian buying indian company phone... Intex you advertise Grand Features but its very poor quality...you let us down. Seriously I am not blindly criticising... did your team test the product or you are blindsiding customers. Does really makes you wonder if its worth buying products on the Web or its better to See, Test and Buy at regular retailers. Now coming to the Phone... Started exploring few of important features mainly one DISPLAY: Is it really HD quality CAMERA: I am not very happy with its supposed to be Sony 13mp Rear Camera Surprised at poor quality of the photos. Does it really have Sony Camera and that too 13MP ?? And the HD Video leaves you wondering what is HD and what is not. FM Radio: Its also pathetic... as instructed with earphone plugged in... it does not pick the stations accurately (some are missed out) and also you need to keep moving around for the stations to sound clear... it reminds you of old childhood times when we used to have Transistor Radios where we had to keep moving around for those AM stations to sound clear, when ever there was change of wind I will still try and see if some tweaks need to be done to set it right... if not I will return the phone or throw it out if Amazon does not accept the return. And I will update the review later what ever the outcome. read more ? 69 users found this review helpful helpful?","28 Aug 2015,"

Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual,5 stars,"very good phone, Sony is Sony","Brought from sony centre, very good phone, Sony is Sony, it has only one competitor i. e. Sony itself, very fast, very good display, no hanging, using from last 19 days, very good camera both, sound quality is awesome in all departments, calling as well as music, movie watching is pleasure, battery life is good, no too heating Some cons can be slightly expensive, taking too much time in charging, and off course it is big so handling me be problem. But I think that these are some limitations not cons as per se. As these can not be solved by any company in the world. If big screen then naturally difficult to handle, if battery is of high capacity then it will take time to recharge, for price every thing which is unique needs more price tag then others. I believe that it is the best phone at in the 6 inch category no brand can beat it at this price. 17 users found this review helpful helpful?","17 Sep 2015,"

Sony Xperia C5 Ultra Dual,2 stars,Not So Good Not SO Bad.......I Suggest Not To BuY this phone,Before buying this C5 Xperia I was in a big Dilemma.... Whether to buy Xperia C5 or Mto X Play......Every one suggested to me to buy Moto X Play After reading some negative comments and reviews also I went with SonyC5.......Because I am a die-hard Sony mobile fan....from last 10-12 yrs I m using Sony only.........But this product (Xperia C5) is not up to mark..... Below are the issues faced by me within 3 days of use :- Pros - 1. Size of phone is too gud. 2. Camera quality is gud both front and rear....as both are of same pixels i.e. of 13. 3. Good looks. Cons - 1. Heating issue.......phone goes on heat w/o using heavily also..if u use simple apps also like whtsapp etc then also set HEATS up. 2. BIGGEST PROBLEM I M FACING is the BATTERY.........I had never expected this from SONY......after spending 26k-27k Battery is not at all up to the mark even extremely POOR BATTERY SONY had deployed on this set. And it takes tooo much time to get charged. 3. Some times my phone does not ring......no alarms sound and etc............ But when I switch off it and again switch on then t works fine.......with in three days of usage i faced this issue twice. 4. Headphone provided with the set also not so good one as compared to the handsfree provided with other sony sets. I will not suggest to buy this phone..........Because it is too highly priced.....and battery is major issue I am facing. I am thinking to return my phone to flipkart...and to replace with some other phone. If any phone which is similar and suggestive to buy........Please share with me....I will appreciate your support and suggestions. read more ? 16 users found this review helpful helpful?,"27 Oct 2015,"

Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus,5 stars,Awesome phone!! Rival to iPhone 6 Plus ....,"I just bought this phone from one of our local store as I was not ready to wait for the delivery time. However, I know Amazon is the most trusted online retailer and my online buying experience have always been fantastic with Amazon. Being an Mobile Application developer I keep on buying phones very frequently and used almost all the handsets. Thus, I need to compromise and overlook the cost factors whatever be the cost. The phone is really costly for the ordinary users but, if you need this for some socio status maintenance in comparison to iPhone then, you can go for it. The honest review from my side is - Pros : 1. Elegant look - Gorilla Corning glass on both sides is making it super shiny. The curved edges are awesome and you will fall in love of these curved edges. Trust me if you go by look then nothing can beat it. In my office most of the people use iPhone still they love this. 2. Absolutely beautiful design - sleekest phone with heavy performance. 3. Display - incomparable display and resolution. 4. Performance wise super fast because of it's Octacore Exynos 7 series processor and 4 GB RAM. I am not a Game lover you can enjoy games to it's fullest. 5. Handset gets heated on extensive network and graphics usage but, manageable. 6. Battery life is fairly good with all day 3G but, not the best (please don't compare it with iPhone) - you can expect 10-12 Hours for calls, continuous WhatsApp and Facebook over 3G. 7. Camera quality is beautiful moreover, you can take beginner level photography shots too. 8. However you can switch on the Ultra Power Saving Mode at low battery(10%) which will keep you running more 8 to 10 hours. 9. Fingerprint sensor is nice and accurate. 10. Multi tasking is beautiful and performance optimised. Cons: 1. Initially I was comparing it with my iPhone 6 Plus with respect to battery it fails but, still if I compare the functionalities, hardware capabilities then surely I am ready to compromise. 2. Sleekest design carries the biggest chance to slip. read more ? 33 users found this review helpful helpful?","01 Sep 2015,"
Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus,4 stars,A perfect phone but....,"According to me its perfect. We dont have to compromise for even a single feature. Everything is packed in one device and the device is samsung, one of the most trusted company but there is only one problem. And thats the price. The price is really really very high. 60,000 Rs for a phone is really very high. If price doesn't matter for the buyer than this one is the perfect or you can go for a Oneplus two if you want similar features at almost half price. 17 users found this review helpful helpful?","29 Aug 2015,"
Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus,5 stars,Undoubtedly the worlds best phone,"I pre-ordered my phone on 26th Aug and received it on the 31 of August, So I am writing a review after a week of use, I will start with a detailed review on the Battery: Day 1(less usage): removed from full charge at 8:00AM in the morning and used till 8:00PM before recharging- from 100% it fell to 55% with less usage like clicking a dozen pics, little whatsapp and facebook and played a few games etc Day 2(High usage): started using it heavily - kept the wifi on whole day, used bluetooth for headset, clicked a few dozen pics& selfies,played games like temple run 2 for about 30 mins,lot of talking etc the battery fell to 33% from 9am to 8pm. So the bottom line is that the 3000Mah battery will easily last you a full day and the best part about it is that it has super fast charging. Now for the others: Display: Its the best! trust me I have never seen anything like it before. the HD videos look crisp and clear. The Edges on both sides make it look absolutely stunning. Camera: This is probably the best part about the phone. The images look beautiful, the pictures are sharp and colors are quite accurate especially in daylight conditions, my colleagues keep asking for my phone when they want to click pics and no loger look for an Iphone! The selfiesby the 5MP cam are very detailed and nice. UI & graphics: The Android is the latest 5.1.1 which is definitely a improvement over the previous one, very simple to use, Most apps and High graphic games run very smoothly and so far I have not experienced any lag, the Apps open very fast and the multi window buttons is very useful. The fingerprint sensor for the lock screen is simply awesome and once you get use to it you will find entering password on other phone very cumbersome. The screen mirroring option with my Samsung smart TV is something I am really enjoying. Call & Audio quality: The call quality is great and the Audio is the really good especially while listening to music. Bottom-line is that this is undoubtedly the worlds best phone, it beats all other flagships at present, so if you can afford it dont think twice. read more ? 14 users found this review helpful helpful?","08 Sep 2015,"

If having a phablet is not a problem with you (one handed operation is a little difficult with a big-sized phone such as this) - this is really the best phone around. Super display. Butter smooth operations. Gorgeous looks that will turn heads the moment you take the phone out of your pocket. Seriously - we have to stop talking about whether the Edge has functionality or not. The dual curved edge display is a thing of beauty - and I will be happy with it even if it had no functionality like the app edge or people edge. 4GB RAM handles everything perfectly. 32GB memory is just right (Apple offers 16GB, which is too low, or 64/128GB which you may not want to pay for). Touchwitz is toned down and is not an irritant. In fact, some of the Samsung software touches are actually useful - like Private mode (which helps you to keep your files or photos private), and the ability to customize the toggles in the notification area (this feature is only available in Android M). The battery easily gets me through a day. The fast charging is really fast (around 1 hour to get from 20% to 100%) - but I'm told it's not always advisable to fast-charge. If you take care to put your fingerprint in properly as instructed, the fingerprint scanner works really fast. The camera is great too - probably better than any phone around right now. (I know there are phones with 20+ MP cameras - but megapixels aren't everything) The metal-glass body looks absolutely premium. Yes - the price is high, but you don't get the best phone in the world for anything less, right? If you absolutely do not want to compromise on any feature, and want to customisability of Android, then this is the phone for you. UPDATE: As on March 2016, this phone is not yet updated with Android M, but they did introduce several android M features gradually before Android M roll-out. For example, you have application permissions here already. You also have a system of choosing to optimise battery app by app (basically restricting apps to perform background functions when you haven't used them for some time). This phone is not available in dual SIM normally, but you can head to eBay for an imported dual SIM model. read more ? 12 users found this review helpful helpful?","21 Oct 2015,"

Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE550KL,4 stars,Overall Good to buy if Camera is not main priority,"I have pre ordered this phone through flipkart and I must mention that overall order fulfillment and delivery of Flipkart is just awesome. Overall a good phone. In some departments the phone is very good and in some it's just average or below average. 1) Built quality is very good. this phone looks and feels sturdy in hand and also feels premium, Not very heavy and not too light either. Weight distribution is good. Does not feel heavy at one end. 2) 5.5 "" 720 p IPS Display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 feels great. Color and brightness is just best in qulality. Touch is awesome. 720p videos run flawlessly and great to watch on this device. 3) 3000 mAH Battery is good to have in a 5.5"" display. Power backup is good. But I am disappointed with the charger. It takes too long to charge the battery but that's adjustable. 4) ZenUI is very good and over my expectation. I have used lenovo UI, MIUI 6 and cynogenmod12 and I must say this ZenUI is no less in comparison. Look n feel is good. I would love to see a bit more Themes in the Theme store, a better secutiry app with app restrictions to use the internet but less preinstalled apps. Too many unremoveable preinstalled apps make this UI heavy taking up 5.26 GB after OTA update. Thus you get 10.8 Gb approx from the 16 Gb internal Memory.2 Gb Ram is good to have these days. Overall operation is smooth and crisp. This phone supports OTG (Tested) 4)Camera (Single Con I found): The 5 mp front cam with FF is good. Nice Capturing range.Beautification mode enhances the image. Photo output is good not great. Yureka and Mi note 4g/ Mi4i has better output. 13Mp rear camera with Dual Tone Flash and Laser focus. Here is where the main trouble arises. The auto Laser focusing is very quick, but you have no idea what outcome you are going to get after you click. Sometimes you get excellent pics but most of the time the photo is noisy and full of grains. I am very impressed with the dual tone flash, it works very good. But for one good photo you need to take 5/6 clicks. This made me depressed. I dint expected this from a hit brand like ASUS, What I feel is that they need more research on the rear camera sensor and need to release a OTA update to fix this issue. Sensor is not performing as expected. Its like a brainless instrument.Very disappointing. This is my first impressions after using this phone for 36 hours. Do give a like if it helps you. read more ? 315 users found this review helpful helpful?","29 Aug 2015,"

Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KL,4 stars,Intial Impression,"Received Asus Zenfone 2 Laser 5.0'' 16GB black variant yesterday. 1.Touch Response and Display is good. 2..No lag in UI. 3.Lot of bloatware are there. Some can be uninstalled and others cannot be uninstalled, but can be disabled. 4 As expected Camera is not good. Average. Lot of Noise is there in Artificial light. 5.Much worried about the battery life since the capacity is just 2070 MAH. 6. Ringtone volume and audio out put is very less. Conclusion : Camera and Games is not a problem for me since I'm not interested in it. There is no lag in UI and is very smooth for our day to day needs. Note : Since they are boasting a lot about Laser Auto focus and 13 MP cam. They could make it work as an atleast above average camera. Hope that Asus will work on it and will release an OTA for the camera performance. Will add a detailed review after using it for few days. 15 users found this review helpful helpful?","07 Sep 2015,"

Forme Y11,5 stars,Must Buy Budget Smart Phone,"I received this phone in last week and its been around 7-8 days that I am using this phone and let me tell you that so far my experience is really awesome. This phone scores ace in almost all aspects like display, battery, memory, RAM, overall look, handling, sound. I am not a very much gaming freak and hence would not comment on the gaming performance as I did not play high definition games on this phone. Matt finish back panel helps to get the grip on phone and also looks elegant. Before buying this phone I was used to operating Android Jelly Bean operating system and so it took me couple of days to get accustom with Android Lollipop. If anyone still going thru online reviews before buying this phone then I would like to tell that I checked most of the reviews available online, found them positive and then only bought this phone. Just go for it. You wont regret. Good Luck! 3 users found this review helpful helpful?","04 Aug 2015,"
Forme Y11,4 stars,Best Smart Phone 2999,"First of all, let me thank Flipkart for on time delivery of this awesome product. I am using this one from last two days, and I must say, performance is rock solid. Its smooth, fast and great performer for daily users like me. Mind it, am not talking about hardcore gamers or people who need their smartphone stuck to their hands 24X7, coz I am not of them. . The feel on hands is very comfortable with its Matte back and its super light.In this price range, you will get only one more phone Overall i want to say, if you want the best of everything then you will have to spend accordingly. I feel sorry for people who crib about everything just for the sake of it when they are willing to spend only 2999. Guys, just go for it blindly if this is what your budget is, you cant get better than this. And if you want better one, then don't hesitate to lighten your pockets 0 users found this review helpful helpful?","05 Sep 2015,"

If I click the screen on the right side, something on the left opens and vice versa. Even after switching off the Auto update still new apps would install on my phone. I even turned off the Download when connected to wifi but still it would download and some apps were weird too. Battery was ok. Phone is very slim and looks good. Main problem is the software and hardware it uses. Would not recommend and have placed a request for return with amazon. Thank god they have a return policy. 0 users found this review helpful helpful?","03 Sep 2015,"

I have experienced it personally. It is getting hot after using just after a minute and gone discharged on standby mode after half an hour with heating problem as well as hanging problem in using a single app at once. I went to service center to rectify this problem but they did not do and charged amount Rs.170/= after telling that your set is out of warrenty. and it is now under repairing from last 7 seven days.

Motorola Moto X Style,4 stars,"Lacks in few departments, but stands out in a lot","So I had desperately been waiting for this phone since 2 months. Motorola definitely made me wait a lot. Well lets analyze this wait was worth it or not. 1) My phone is heating up like a microwave oven in 2 days use !! 2)I got my X style for 28000(after some offers), I feel its slightly overpriced(for 30000). Biggest feature which I miss about this phone is, that it lacks MOTO MAKER. Well this is something I was expecting to be there in this phone but Motorola has just not released moto maker in India. I would be happy with a price tag of 30000 had moto maker been there. 3) Another thing that goes against this phone is BATTERY which is strictly AVERAGE. 4) There is a lack of FINGERPRINT SCANNER as well. Now these were the cons lets look at Pros..Now lets look at what goes best: 1) Smooth processor Seriously very smooth. 2) Its not difficult to hold phone despite such a large size of screen, as moto has worked on phone s dimensions nicely. 3) Moto assist, moto voice etc, moto display awesome features. 4) Turbo charging helps a lot in time of need for a careless guy like me. 5) Screen: QHD(looks awesome) 6) The camera is also very nice, stands out. 7) The front facing firing speakers out shines completely. 8) The build quality is good, metal looks premium. 9) Dual sim phone, and micro sd card which is missing in most of expensive phones these days. 10) Voice quality of calls is very nice. 11) Stock android experince, will soon get Marshmallow update. 12) The front camera has flash(rare as if now in phones). 13) Twisting phones opens camera and other features are nice So basically the number of benefits outshines the number of cons.. So with my initial usage I can say that it is RECOMMENDED ! I would have rated it 5 stars, had moto maker had been there. Rite nw I wil settle with 4 stars :) read more ? 15 users found this review helpful helpful?","27 Oct 2015,"
Motorola Moto X Style,5 stars,Brilliant phone and excellent service by flipkart,"The phone was released on 24th of October and I received it on the 26th of October. Great speedy delivery by flipkart(and awesome packaging too). Coming to the phone: The phone is just awesome, great to hold and looks stunning(almost bezelless) The highlighting feature is the camera- 21 mp is just awesome and the selfie flash is great. The phone is filled with sensors enhancing the user experience and is very snappy and fast. The snapdragon 808 handles everything exceptionally and has no heating issues yet. The speakers are great(very loud) excellent for viewing videos and playing games. The turbo charging again is the deal breaking feature for me, charges my phone super fast. Well cannot currently think of any cons... will try to keep you updated if I find any. 12 users found this review helpful helpful?","27 Oct 2015,"
Motorola Moto X Style,5 stars,Awesome Phone,"I received my moto X style last day and let me give the initial review. Pros: 1. Excellent display even though they are not using AMOLED display. You have options in the display settings to make the display either normal or vibrant. 2. Both front and back cameras are awesome. Even the photos taken in dark places appears good. 3. Another important feature that I like to emphasize is Moto Action and Moto Voice. Using these you can use your phone hands-free. 4. Then comes TURBO CHARGING...it takes only very less time to get charged from 0% top about 50%. 5. I have used Moto G previously and the one thing I was concerned most while buying MXS was its look and bulky. But MXS is nothing like Moto G...due to is curved design ..it looks sleek and the look is also pretty decent. 6. An earphone, turbo charger and a bumper case comes with the box. Although the b uilt quality of the earphone is not that great but the sound quality is pretty good. Cons 1. The most important disadvantage of this phone is its battery. It has only 3000 mah battery and it drains so quickly. Rigorous usage of the phone drains battery within 8-9 hours. But thanks to turbo charging ...you can charge it pretty fast. 2. I had bought MXS with 16 GB ROM. But out of this 16GB, only ~10gb is available for the user. But since MXS supports external SD card upto 128 GB, this is not actually a great concern. All together , this phone is a good phone with awesome specs. All the cons have an alternative solution to it ..Hence I find Moto X style one of the best phones in the market. read more ? 7 users found this review helpful helpful?","30 Oct 2015,"

IBall Andi 5K Infinito2,3 stars,Not As Expected to be,From the specs this phone looks beast but it isn't.1) It has MT8392 chipset worst performing Octa-Core CPU which is not mentioned in specification.2) For 4000 mah battery it should last at least for 11 hours SOT and this one died on 7hrs 20mns SOT from 100% to 1% On Power Saving mode. 3) since it is KitKat 4.4.2 you can't write on SD card(it means you can't delete or paste anything on SD card) otherwise you get 7.9 GB for Apps and for 4.48 GB for User data and 1.9 GB RAM as Internal storage. 4) For Benchmark lovers it scores 28800+ on Antutu 6.0 Tip...

Gionee Pioneer P2M,2 stars,1 4 inch screen so for all those who don't want to feel like they are holding a brick to their ear each ...,"Pros: 1) 4 inch screen so for all those who don't want to feel like they are holding a brick to their ear each time they call, this size is ideal! 2) Par excellent battery life 3) Overall specs for the price are good; has Android Lollipop in it. Cons: 1) Someone mentioned in another review the the Call App crashed each time the loudspeaker option is turned on. I faced the same issue; was told to take it to their store to get it fixed. I just chose to upgrade the application while connected on Wifi and that seemed to solve my problem. But it is strange that such an error should come up in the first place. Shows that the UI is not thoroughly tested! 2) Worst problem I am facing is that each time I am browsing an app like Gmail or LinkedIn or say browsing the news on Economic Times, the particular app just reboots and goes off the page I am currently on. While the phone does not reboot, the app itself goes back to a previous page for no rhyme or reason. Has resulted in me having to keep hitting the save draft button each time I am keying in an email. Will try to see if this problem goes away after trying another upgrade. 3) Front camera is horrible... equivalent camera in my earlier Panasonic T11 phone had much better clarity. 4) Sound quality could have been better. 5) Data connectivity is sketchy. 6) The power on/off button on the right side tends to be depressed while speaking and has resulted in calls getting disconnected a few times. Should have been on the top of the phone. Perhaps there is a way to set such that call does not get disconnected even if the button is pressed, but then maybe I have not figured it out yet. 7) SARS value is also quite high for the phone, hence better to use earphone than holding it close to the ear. 8) Weight of the phone is higher. Overall, just an OK low cost phone, which seems to have high specs but which does not deliver as expected.. read more ? 4 users found this review helpful helpful?","11 Apr 2016,"

Lava Flair Z1,1 stars,SIM2 Does not work. Faulty Phone.,"Please do not buy this phone. I took a chance looking at the specs and purchased this one over Motorola. The biggest issue with the phone is that you cannot use SIM2. It simply shows out of coverage area. I tried with different SIMs, same problem. I don't know whether it was my piece or overall Z1 flair, but I would really recommend staying away from this.Also, the design and camera were good, but the display was washed out. So overall, considering the SIM2 problem, i would give it 1 star at the most. Please get something else like Moto E (2nd Gen) instead of this. 2 users found this review helpful helpful?","14 Sep 2015,"

Spice Power 5855,2 stars,The seller messed up,Ordered a Titanium Grey colour phone and they delivered a Silver White colour one... I requested a replacement and have to wait for 5 days more..for that and guess what they delivered a Silver White one again..so don't but it from Yash Communication even if they give a good discount or any offer. i ordered it foe my parents but they are ok with it..so... Giving 2 stars for the phone and not to the seller.. will not recommend the seller but will recommend the phone for that budget.. 0 users found this review helpful helpful?,"14 Mar 2016,"

Samsung Galaxy Note 5,5 stars,The best smartphone of 2015!,"I bought this phone from a local vendor, coz amazon was not giving delivery at my address :( I have been using it for the last 3 months, this is my review of it: Pros: Great battery life, almost 1.5 times than s6 and equal to iphone 6 plus(my previous phone). Amazing looks, this phone is definitely a head turner. The ability to use the stylus on the locked screen is really helpful. Build quality is much better than the previous generation notes. QHD amoled display is far more amazing than iphone 6 Camera works great in day as well as in night. Shutter speed is pretty fast. HDR pictures are life like. Optical image stabilisation. Finger print scanner works like a charm. 4G compatiblity Multitasking is as smooth as it should be. Thanks to the 4gb RAM NFC, Fast and wireless charging Multi page screen shot helps while capturing a long document or an entire web page. Cons: The glossy back is finger print magnet, have to clean it now and again. No option of expanding the memory, 32gb on this device seems way to less. Touchwiz interface No option of dual sim Costly No infra red, so cannot use the phone as a remote. Verdict: No phone is perfect, everyphone has its pros and cons. It just depends upon your need. If you are looking for a great looking phone with amazing camera and good battery life go for it. You wont regret. I am really happy with this device. Update:- The battery life of this is proving to be pretty good, with heavy use I am comfortably getting one day worth of battery life. Fast charging is able to charge the phone from 10-100 percent in just 90 mins :) :) Note: Wait for a month or so, the rates will come down by atleast '5000. If you liked my review, rate it helpuful. Thanks Update:- The rates actually came down by Rs.7000 :D :D read more ? 212 users found this review helpful helpful?","23 Sep 2015,"

HTC Desire 826x,1 stars,Not Worth Spending money on this,"My Requirement for buying this mobile: 1. cdma+gsm 2. dual sim should be active instead of dual sim standby. 3. Good Camera 4. 2gb RAM 5. Latest Android 6. Good brand 7. 4g in gsm slot and evdo on cdma slot. My Observation after purchasing this mobile: 1. cdma+gsm - Pass 2. dual sim should be active instead of dual sim standby. - Fail 3. Good Camera - Pass 4. 2gb RAM - Pass (good performance) 5. Latest Android - pass 6. Good brand - Pass 7. 4g in gsm slot and evdo on cdma slot. - Fail(The most decisive point for selecting this model, however due to its design failure disappointed me a lot). slot 1 is for cdma as well as 4g, due to which you could not use cdma while having a gsm sim card for 4g. Then what is the point of having dual sim mobile. HTC should have done proper ground work done before releasing such models in to market. I bet this is going to be a complete failure model from HTC. It also has some kind of network issues. So finally i had to ask Flipkart to return this Item as it is a complete cheating to customers by HTC. Hopefully i get my refund from Flipkart. I will just rate One star because of its camera,processing speed, display and touchscreen. 17 users found this review helpful helpful?","13 Sep 2015,"

Although I know Asus products are very good and using this device for 2 days I can say soon Asus is going to rule the smartphone industries. So far as my concern Pros: Very light weight screen resolution is awesome very good camera quality even in low light.

Asus Zenfone Go,5 stars,I am Stoned,"Hi, So i ordered this phone on 1st of oct..it had no reviews still i went for it, expected delivery date was 13th but as per flipkart goodwill it got it delivered by 9th of Oct. Well i was high when i first gave a look into it..And what is this shit..I did not expect this thing will have graspy look.. So here you go, 1.The touch is quite responsive and fast enough.. 2.Processor is fast enough to handle 30 multiple apps at the same time. 3.Ram woooh this shit is really good..Opening Apps like hookers open their mouths..oops! my computer has also 2gb ram.waa :( 4,.Now this graphics card supports FIFA 15 and graphics is GODLIKE! I tried NFS most wanted..there is no LAG or DELAY in this high graphics game..FUCK gamers like me should by this..atleast better to have a phone worth of 20k and better spend on your PC 5.Camera! HA HA HA! at first i was not even able to find camera..then i found it is under PHOTOGRAPHY.. Rear Camera: YES it is good..seems like 8MP..Picture is clear Front Camera: No babes please do not buy this phone for your uglylooking selfies..but yeah you can video chat. 5.Internal Storage is 4gb accesable. 6.no 4G waa...but thats fine 3G speed is quite good. 7.IF u want a phone that looks good..this phone does that have quality..its so slim that if you are not handling it like a baby it will fall..Please ASUS atleast give a basic screenguard...OH GOD. 8.SOUND YES MUSIC LOVERS oops! there is no headphone in the BOX..but yes i used my PHILIPS headphones and music clarity is good..BASE LEAD RHYTHM VOCAL evrything is crystal clear...Loud speaker is also having a artistic sound, its loud enough guyz. 9.Finally this comes to battery..oh yeah..every smartphone users will have this query..Honestly everyone fears about battery.. No guyz 2070 is not GOOD enough. if you surf this phone hard and play games for whple day it will last about 1 day. So if you are living in a village where power cut is a daily bread then you should not buy this. But yeah if u can roam with the charger or Power Banks you SHOULD BUY. SO my final ratings: LOOKS-5/5 SPEED:4/5 CAMERA:4/5 TOUCH:5/5 CONS: 1.This phone is not having any screenguard,.Buy screenguard ASAP. 2.NO headphones.. What? Searching for more? Order it fast. read more ? 5 users found this review helpful helpful?","11 Oct 2015,"

White Cherry Mi2,5 stars,An excellent budget android phone with super features,"The phone I booked for my wife with some hesitation but after receiving, I felt relaxed to see all the functions and accessories (flip cover/screen guard) supplied with it. The outlook is great. It has 2 sims, 1 micro and 1 normal. The unforeseen feature of the phone is that it is a slim phone, only 8.2 mm thick. OS is kitkat 4.4.2. The pre-installed apps are good. The speed over 3G and wifi is very good with its 512mb ram. The display is a IPS one and 5.2 inches!!!! its awesome.... Camera clarity is good for both front and back. Loudspeaker sound is a bit low , I felt, but it is OK. the headset supplied is very attractive and gives a very good output. The sound recorder is so-so. All the sensors are working fine. The only cons which I saw that the charging USB cord is a bit on shorter side. The delivery of the product strictly followed the timeline promised. All together it is a very good but affordable product for indian market and it is truly friend's envy.

Larger and good screen quality(2.4 Inch) 2. It has a inbuilt browser, not very useful but better than having no internet support(Nokia 130 or Guru Music) 3. It can import Contacts using VCF file. (This is one of the challenge when you use basic phone) 4. Nice music player and radio that you can play in background as well. 5. Video player (havent tried yet). 6.

Celkon Millennia Q5K Power,3 stars,Product promise good battery life.,"First no one have reviewed this product till now. So, I thought my experience with this product could be help full for the people who are planning to buy it. So, First the good stuff. Yes, The 5000mAh Provide good talk time. Means your phone battery will last longer than any other phone. And that's it. Now, come the more interesting part the ""Bad Part."" Ram 512 Mb. You will not be able to open Facebook messenger and surf the INTERNET at the same time. Let put it this way, any social networking android app will make you realize that you have 512 Mb Ram. In my case Phone was hanging at first for no reason at all. Then I update the inbuilt app present in this device. And everything seems alright then. It just stop working.

Philips E310,4 stars,Four Stars,Best phone for senior citizen. 14 users found this review helpful helpful?,"08 Mar 2016,"
Philips E310,1 stars,Defective Piece with Issues..Disappointed!,"The product was delivered well within time, thanks to Amazon's prompt service. Coming to the phone, i brought it in the month of July, for my Mom. She was happy to receive it owing to the ease in operations it provided her with - large key pad, clear & large fonts on the screen, wide, clear & bright screen, single button for torch & lock/unlock, SOS, easy SMS options, one button radio, & clarity of voice on making or receiving calls. Plus it had an SD card slot for additional storage needs. I was glad i brought this phone for her to make things easier. Its been two months since i brought the phone now, all was working well until suddenly last week, the MIC stopped working & Mom was unable to hear what was being spoken on the other end whenever she made or received calls! She had to use the H-Free or Loudspeaker option to be able to hear anyone speak! Further, the Adapter of the charger stopped working all of a sudden & i had to buy another adapter to connect the USB cable of the phone for charging! So both these defects in the phone have left me pretty disappointed with the product, that too within just 2 months of purchase!! Don't know if i received a defective product or the phone quality itself is a little poor. Did anyone else have a similar experience with the phone? Whatever the case, there is no Philips Service Centre in my city & i am having to give the phone away to a local repair shop now, for MIC repair apart from the additional cost i had to incur for buying a new adapter! I do not think that a 4000 bucks phone from a company like Philips will be that poor in quality! I cannot even return or replace the product with Amazon because its past time for the same. But i do hope that these kind of repairs do not crop up every now & then because then, buying this phone will prove to be a total loss for Mom & me! Looks like i got a defective or duplicate piece from Amazon! Hope they ensure & do a thorough quality check & a check for its originality before displaying them for sale on the site. As far as this purchase from Amazon is concerned, i am Disappointed customer. A great phone but didn't work good enough! read more ? 13 users found this review helpful helpful?","08 Sep 2015,"

Philips E310,2 stars,Evaluate carefully . Tis is the most expensive seniors phone available on Amazon but does not deliver its promise.,"The product has inconsistent quality . I vought two in a gap of a week and while one is working okay , the other has a problem that the voice is not transmitted when making or receiving a call. The reseller gave a 10 days return period and this problem was detected only after that period. I now don't know what to do. The other problem is that the speaker is on the rear so if the phone is placed on its back on a soft surface like a bed , the chances are the ringing tone will not be heard even if on full volume . Most senior citizens have hearing problem of some sort so they is a definite challenge with the product. 4 users found this review helpful helpful?","06 Nov 2015,"
ZTE Blade Q Lux 4G,2 stars,Read Before you buy,"Waiting for some genuine and good review by a amazon verified purchaser. Those people making claims like got the phone yesterday or using it for past two days should know that if they have really got hands on the device/have purchased it from Amazon (I think no other retailer is selling it, so he/she should definitely buy it from Amazon ), Amazon list him/her as a verified purchaser. But most of such persons here don't have an amazon verified purchaser tag and still claims that they got the phone. I smell something fishy here. May be they are ZTE employees or paid reviewers (remember what Nubia was doing!!!). I wonder how many people have really purchased this phone and have hands on with the phone(I can see only 2 verified buyer here) I am giving a two star only for the great specs they have managed at this price. If you are not sure of the quality you may look for the following devices (a little expensive though) 1.Xiaomi Redmi2 - Nice looks, good build, HD screen and a great camera. 2.Coolpad Dazen1 - almost same specification as Redmi2 but has 2GB RAM and costs only Rs.5999. 3.Yu yuphoria - 2GB RAM, metal frame and other specs same as Redmi2. This phone doesn't have a flash and I doubt how its camera going to stand up against Redmi2 or likes of infocous m2 .

ZTE Blade Q Lux 4G,4 stars,Impressive Features for such a low price updated 02072015,"ZTE has already offered a lot of devices with better features at competitive price. ZTE blade QLUX is one of them.i am not going to compare it with other high end phones with same specifications and with a higher price Tag. #>Will try to keep it sweet ,simple and to the point. With this handset you doubtlessly get much more than you pay for. Although to be honest you should't be expecting a camera quality seen in a 10k mobile with 8MP.You shouldn't be racing for megapixel because it doesn't make a camera better. But blade QLUX is probably the best camera you could get for 5k ,also the front snapper too. It sports a 4.5 inch screen which is perfect for single handed use. The handset looks much premium on hands on experience. it has GPS with Glonass assistance which is rarely seen in budget phones. One more rare feature is updates ZTE has promised lollipop updates for this phone.mostly rare in budget android devices. The screens not HD but for a 4.5 inches its enough and the 218ppi avoids pixelation. Mediatek MT6732M is the same we have seen in sony xperia E4g.And it powers the device well to keep it lag free. Mali-T760MP2 which was one of the fastest back in 2013 ,is still capable of giving the handset a better Graphics and gaming performance. (Though you have seen the same GPU in lenovo a7000 and xperia c4 to be specific). 8gb internal may be enough but as far as app installation is concerned on 4.5GB free for that.Rest is taken as other storage.Better consider buying atleast a class 10 memory card. Battery backup is surprisingly good and better than most in the same segment.You can expect a full day backup on average usage. The software and hardware are well optimized to avoid much of the heating. One more thing to be aware is the 4g part.Only one sim supports 4g the 2nd one supports only 2g . ------------------------------------------------------------- #>Everything has its flaws: not the lightest for a 4.5 incher.but light enough. Loud speakers are loud enough but sound quality is not that great. Automatic brightness does have some bugs.[waiting for the update] #>Would i Recommend it. Yes! surely,as far as the price is concerned its one of the best you could get.And as i said,don't keep your expectations high though you get much more than you pay for. ______________________________________ read more ? 10 users found this review helpful helpful?","25 Jun 2015,"

HTC One ME Dual SIM,4 stars,AMAZING MUSIC EXPERIENCE!! GO FOR IT!!!,"I have been using this model for a month now, and I must say no issues till now. No hangs, no glitches, no sudden restarts; none. As per my opinion following are the pros 1) Amazing front dual speakers:- Yes the quality stands out completely when compared to any other non HTC mobile in it's range. Come on they are Dolby and have Surround audio. No comparison whatsoever. You won't get such an experience on any other non-HTC mobile. 2) In-ear Music experience:- The ""BOOMSOUND"" has it's advantage and you really understand the difference when you switch it off. The music is really crisp, the HIGHs are very clear and the LOWs are not artificial. Plug-in a high end ear phone and you will have an amazing experience, with the surround sound adding itself to the experience. 3) Front-Camera:- one of the sharpest cameras in this price range. The colours are not artificial and the clarity is really mindblowing. a perfect selfie camera. 4) Screen Clarity:- It's a 2k resolution. What more can you ask for. You get to see beautiful colours and really sharp images. Great clarity. 5) Fast operation:- The mobile has not yet given up on it's smooth functioning, is very smooth in operation. Though we are a bit doubtful about Media Tek Processors when we are aiming for a high end mobile, let me assure you the Helio processor is really really good. no Lags till now. 6) Built Quality:- its HTC!!! Need I say more??? the premium feel you get when handling this device can't even be compared to any other devices from it's range. It's not heavy and yet it's not too light and hence it has that premium feel. 7) HTC sense 7:- The look and feel is really good and comfortable. I loved it. 8) Design:- Look at it man, it's BEAUTIFUL!! Yes people stop and ask for it's name. It's an eye catcher. 9) Fingerprint Scanner:- It is very fast and seldom fails to scan a finger. I would say 95% of the times it is accurate. CONS:- 1) Chrome:- the keyboard kind is slow and does not respond fast while you are using it in chrome. I have no idea why so but it is laggy. 2) Keyboard:- At times it kind of behaves laggy. The most irritating feature is that you can't select just the ""Word Prediction"" option alone. The ""Word Prediction"" option in itself has a ""Word Replacement"" feature. So the suggested word will replace your word automatically IF your word is not saved in the dictionary. And this really starts getting annoying after a while. If you de-select this option then no word selections for you. You cannot change the keyboard skins nor can you customize it's layout. I had a Sony Xperia Z and you could do anything and everything with it's keyboard. While for some this might not be a problem but for me since I use the keyboard extensively, it annoys me to no limits. 3) Battery Life:- Batter life is slightly below average WHEN using internet continuously. While this is common with every other mobile out there, when comparing it with my Sony, the latter had a much better battery back-up. If the internet is off(both WiFi and mobile net) the stand-by is pretty good. When in music mode, the battery is decent, not as good as the Xperia's battery back-up. I must say Sony has the best battery back-up when it comes to listening to music. While I must say HTC ONE ME battery charging time is really short. It charges up really fast. 4) Back cover:- The Back Cover attracts finger prints very easily. While I personally find it a bit messy since it becomes sticky after some use. I wipe it every time with a cloth to remove the stickiness. 5) NO WATER PROOF FEATURE. I would say for the price you are paying, it is an amazing mobile. Recommended for those who LOVE listening to music and want a really good experience. The Speakers are mindblowing and watching movies without any ear phones is an experience in itself. The screen quality is also really great. But yes HTC's build quality is what makes it special. you get that premium feel of using a really high end mobile for a price of 35k. Go for it. read more ? 14 users found this review helpful helpful?","10 Dec 2015,"
HTC One ME Dual SIM,5 stars,Best Dual Sim smartphone out there,"Hi, I have purchased it from retailer and got it for 36K on 18 Aug 2015 with VAT bill. Have used it for about a week now and I must say this is very good handset at this price range. Following is my feedback which might help you. Pros : 01] 32 GB internal will give you enough space to install huge games and many apps (I have installed around 10 GB of high end games 02] 3GB RAM will give you buttery smooth performance 03] 20 MP rear cam is superb and gives you clear normal/bokeh/photobooth images and 4K/slow mo/fast forward video 04] 2K 565ppi display is crystal clear and have 178 degree viewing angle 05] Very responsive finger print sensor which lets you add 5 fingers 06] UltraPixel front cam for wide angel, low light support selfie 07] HTC Boom Sound speakers with HD audio play back (Note: they are not very loud but loud and clear enough to enjoy) 08] 4G on one sim and 2G on other which lets you use high speed internet with less battery drain 09] Poly-carbonate back gives you less heat feeling and rich look 10] Dual Nano SIM and 2TB external storage support, what else you need? 11] Features like,auto answer when directly held over ear, flip to mute, louder in pocket, goes to lower ring when picked up are added bonus feature 12] HTC Sense 7 with blink feed is good experience and launcher is smooth and lite 13] Many inbuilt apps to have as added advantage for photo and video editing but no bloatware 14] Octa core 2.2 GHz helio x10 processor for fast and responsive multi tasking 15] PowerVR G6200 GPU lets you run any game you throw at it with no lag (depends on number of background app you run i have around 10-15 background apps running always) 16] In ear headsets are just superb and very very loud and clear! 17] Extreme Power Saver will help you to last for a day with only 5% batter! 18] NFC support let me use my Jabra ROX and JBL Pulse NFC features to just tap and connect! 19] IR remote sensor lets you use your mobile to operate set up box, TV etc. Tried it with my Sony Bravia smart TV. Didn't worked with Panasonic AC though. Cons : 01] Battery back is not up to the mark, battery drains in 5 Hrs video play back at auto brightness and with headsets. On normal usage, continuous WiFi enabled, 30 min calls, 30 min audio and 30 min video play back, battery can last for a day. 02] Older version of lollipop 5.0.2, we need updated 5.1.1 with more smoother animations and yes update to M. 03] In pitch dark you can not have selfie so lack of front flash 04] 4K video length is max 6 min. 05] USB cable supplied is short and no extra accessory except headsets and a pair of extra nano sim slot, in case if you loose original one. 06] No fast charge but battery gets charged from 0 to 100 within 2 hrs approx 07] USB 2.0, no new flat USB cable which is better one I hope this help you. read more ? 12 users found this review helpful helpful?","25 Aug 2015,"

Huawei Honor 7,5 stars,Wondering Why I gave it a 4 Read on..,"I got the phone two weeks after the Order date. Thanks to Flipkart's excuses of the Big Billion day and the huge logistics rush. I'd like to deep dive into the Con's first and the Pro's will follow: Alert: If # 4&6 of the Con's matter to you, don't buy this device. Con's: 1. Heats up a bit in normal usage @ times(I'd call this warm while most android users wouldn't)- The solution would be to Change the Power Saving Setting to Smart instead of Performance. 2. The Phone Seemed to lag a bit at the start, first two days. I don't face this issue anymore. 3. The battery did not last a 9 hrs with moderate usage after the first charge but I discovered that it lasts well over one day after 5-6 Charging Cycles 4. The Back Panel feels a bit slippery- Needs some careful handling- I'd recommend a good Silicone cover. 5. I faced some issues with Whatsapp Notifications being displayed when Whatsapp is killed- Found a solution for this on XDA Developers. 6. The Model sold in India comes with a single SIM when compared to the one sold elsewhere (UK/Rest of the world) which comes with a dual Sim + NFC (Yes, No NFC is available and it isn't really necessary I feel) 7. There isn't an inbuilt equalizer in the Stock Music App yet the quality of the sound output is Amazing (This should have been in the Pros but I'm just setting the context for the best features to follow :-D) Pros: (Best @ the Last) 1.Superior Build Quality- Feels premium, great design and the curved edges(like the one on iPhone 4s) make it look amazing. 2.The Screen is a killer- Makes an instant impression for itself. Flawless and appealing. Great Viewing Angles and good Visibility in Sunlight. 3.The Main 20 Mp Camera does an exceedingly good job and comes with a Sapphire Glass coating (IT is more Scratch resistant than a Gorilla Glass). Has great photo modes (Panorama, Good Food, Beautify to name a few..) and Video modes like Time LApse, Slow Motion, Normal with a lot off effects. The Aperture f2.0 lens help click great shots. 4. Comes with a Scratch guard installed- You needn't run to a shop to get it stuck and No bubbles whatsoever. Very Precisely stuck. 5. Voice Wakeup: Although not a very mature feature, helps place call, find the misplaced phone etc. 6. The UI looks flawless with no App Drawer. Zooming in on the screen brings up Hidden Apps where we can hide apps from the main screen. 7. The Selfie Camera: The best camera I have encountered on a device. Can be shot by simple tap on the scree/Volume button and touching the Finger print Sensor. 8. Gestures/Motions: Enable easier usage of the devices, Supports drawing letters to open Apps. Swipe up, Swipe down on the finger print sensor which acts as a soft touch input., double tap on screen and much more. 9. IR Blaster (The Remote Controller): Easy to configure. Supports most of my devices @ home. 10. Sound Output: Eventhough the speakers are only above average, the sound output from the device produces well refine bass that creates a great listening experience. 11. Customizable Function Key: One of the best features thats unavailable in a lot of premium phones. Lets open different apps/action for the three functions (Single Press, Double Press and Long Press) 12. The Killer Fingerprint sensor: The best Sensor by far on a phone. No need to press. A gentle touch on the sensor that is so ergonomically placed unlocks your phone. The Fingerprint sensor is quick. Go ahead and compare it with the iPhone's/Samsung's/One Plus 2's. Will win head on. My Conclusion: If you have a budget of ~22k, go for this phone if convinced. You will be amazed by the Build quality, the Vibrant Gorilla Display, Front and Rear Cameras, the smart design and the Finger print sensor for this Price. A great Value for money. read more ? 35 users found this review helpful helpful?","03 Nov 2015,"

Huawei Honor 7,1 stars,After sales service,"Hello All, I brought this mobile on 2nd Nov. 2015 and it's good in camera quality design and all other features but on 16th December i had one issue with it. On that day it's display suddenly went out means I can't see who is calling me and all that. I went to service center nearest to me in Baroda, Gujarat. where they checked and said we have to shipped it to Chennai for repairing and it will take max. 20 days. I submitted mobile to them on 17th December. Now the biggest issue came in front of me that after submitting mobile till the date means 17th Jan. 2016 I neither get my device back nor the service center person & customer support center person clarify actual status means actually what happen to my phone. Even though they call center person not transfer my call to their higher authorities or may be their higher authority didn't want to talk with us.

LG G4 Dual,4 stars,"A nice buy for big screen lovers, performance, extra ordinary camera and more","It may look similar to G3 but LG has done a lot to differentiate it from other flagship devices. LG G4 is not just about specs but also the quality it holds. As you can see the bezels are small,which is really good for gaming and viewing FULL-HD Videos. The phone has a beautiful curve which make it excellent to hold. The display is surely one of the best to date and has to be seen to be believed. LED notification has over 8 colors,different for different notification. LG G4 has a removable battery which is rare in flagship devices.The battery backup is stellar for such a powerful device better do a research online about battery before buying. snapdragon 808 is surely a cooler version of 810(heating issues solved to some extent) The benchmarks may not be better than some other flagship but the real life experience is somewhat different and better. at the end you don't need to worry about performance when going for this beast. The camera with a 16MP and 1.8 aperture size seems to perform better in every condition. The daylight with HDR can handle the extra contrast really well resulting is excellent and sharper images.Even though samsung says s6 is best in low light by comparing it with iphone 6.they just didn't compare it with LG G4 which has the best 1.8 aperture size for stunning and sharp low light than most of the competition.The shutter lag is a little bit annoying.Its not the slowest but slow compared to other flagship.Selfie is surprisingly sharp. That's not the end either. The LG G4 has a laser focusing module on the back, which helps for focusing at low light and every difficult condition faster. The buttons at the back will take little time to adapt to. The sunlight viewability is great. The specs are definitely future proof. It also has optional wireless charging feature, which is Qi-enabled Above all the price is low than other flagships. Update: LG Has released an update to fix some minor issues with heating and all.

LG G4 Dual,5 stars,"Seen the Great, Felt the Great","Got this mobile from a retail store about 10 days back and boy what a mobile this is!!! I'll give you an overview of what i am experiencing with this mobile. DISPLAY :- It is one of the best. Its hard to take ur eyes off the screen. Colours are optimally saturated to make things vibrant (not too vibrant as in samsung). At max setting the display is bright and outdoor visibility wont be a problem. Add to this the slight curve and the compact 5.5inch form factor and u have got an awesome display in ur hands. PERFORMANCE :- The Snapdragon 808 as LG claims, seems to be nicely optimised for this mobile. There have been no hiccups so far. The graphics processor could have been a bit powerful though. Nevertheless, it will very much suffice ur daily usage and the occasional gaming sessions. UI :- This is one area where LG has evolved a lot. The UI is a lot smoother and it runs without any lags. LG hasnt compromised on the customisability. Bloatware is minimal and there are a few nice touches that will make using this mobile a lot easier (eg- smart cleaning, double tap to wake, dual window etc etc). CAMERA :- This is perhaps the best smartphone camera available now. Needs no introduction. Its AWESOME. The camera UI is minimal without any unnecessary filters. Most of the times u will find that the Auto mode will suffice, but if u have a bit of photography knowledge, Manual mode is what u would love the most. Ability to adjust the White Balance (in Kelvin values), Shutter speed (from as low as 1/6000 to as high as 30secs), Iso (50-2700), Exposure and Focus is a boon for those who want the best shot possible. Add to this the the ability to save the image in RAW format and u perhaps cant go wrong with this camera. Most of the times people compare this camera to that of S6, but believe me this one is the clear winner. The S6 produces great shots no doubt, but in low light this is the camera u wud want. Daylight pictures are more or less same for both except the fact that S6 produces images that are a lot saturated and may apparently look better to the eye. Same goes for the front camera as well. At 8mp, this is one of the best selfie camera. A few cons regarding the camera :- 1. Video recording and audio capture is not the best. The aggressive OIS makes videos wobbly and audio capture is not that good. There is no 60fps 1080p mode which is a bummer. 2. The camera tends to over expose and sometimes u will find the background light to be blown out. 3. Post processing is quite aggressive and occassionally u may note some artefacts(while u have zoomed in to the image). BATTERY :- Despite the fact that this is a 2k display, i have so far always got a Screen on time of 4-4.5hrs, which is quite good. Moreover, the back is removable and u can easily swap the battery. LG is providing an extra battery and battery cradle charger for those who pre-order/buy the mobile before 15th june. The mobile supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, but quick charger doesnt come out of the box. The provided charger (of 1.8Amps) charges a bit slow and it will take around 120-130mins for a full charge from 0% (provided u dont use the mobile during charging orelse charging rate will slow down even more). PRICING :- 49990 has now become a standard price tag for flagships and this phone is no exception. But since S6 and i6 are now available for a much lower price, its going to be hard for LG to attract customers (although G4 variant launched in India is dual sim and LG is providing free 3 months screen replacement alongwith 1leather + 1plastic back cover). However, having used this mobile for quite some time now, i must say this smartphone is totally worth the price. All in all this a great phone and certainly one that i will suggest to people in hunt for a flagship. The cons are not deal-breakers and im sure u wont even think about those after a few days. read more ? 23 users found this review helpful helpful?","11 Jun 2015,"

LG G4 Dual,5 stars,LG G4 A practical performer with timeless beauty.,"So I was in search of a new phone in the market, online market that is. Even though, I own an iPhone 5C which is almost 1.5 - 2 Years old and do love to keep Apple products as my primary device(s) of choice (Like smartphone, laptop etc), being a designer myself I don't keep myself restricted to one eco-system. I do love Android and the opportunities it brings for designers in designing great applications. That being said, in recent months world has seen some of the most beautiful and functional smart phones ever made. My requirement was quite clear from the start when I wanted to get a smartphone - A premium Android smartphone, budget no bar. I went through a box full of devices from Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, the OnePlus One, couple of other premium smartphones from Huawei, Lenovo, Asus etc; tried and tested them in showrooms and getting them for a day or so with help of some of my friends who own them. I liked the S6 Edge by far the most, but then after 2 days of usage, I felt no functional use of the curved edges other than the calls and smart edge feature and some amount of eye candy. Even though its a real well made phone with amazing camera, screen and built...the short battery killed it for me. Ofcourse, there is fast charging support but then what is the use of a larger pipe to fill a vessel when the vessel itself gets empty now and then. Maybe, Samsung takes care of this in next version of phone. I turned my attention to LG, which has a very very specific following unlike the large population almost the size of small country which follows Samsung & Apple. Even though, I had read several reviews of earlier ""G"" devices and its innovative button placement on back and real good camera, it was the G4 when I finally had a real chance to get a hands on of the smartphone. What grabbed my attention was the practical appeal for which Android smartphones were made - Replaceable battery (Icing on cake - its 3000MaH, unlike S6 / S6 E) and card slot for memory expansion. I saw the Black Leather back G4 and was immediately impressed by its classic design. It does not shout aesthetics and cool design like iPhone 6 or S6 Edge but it more of subdued yet beautiful design which if taken care properly will last atleast for 3-4 Years easily. Coupled that with a little curved horizontal design of screen and full glass from top to bottom and oh my it is a beauty on table; for sure you are going to get compliments and questions from people passing by your desk in office on ""Which phone is that ?"". The design on back is another story altogether, with its stitched leather backing (Its real animal sourced leather with vegetable tanning) and the awesome, almost aesthetic placement of buttons with camera showcases the amount of work LG designers have put into the device. Now the real deal - Screen : Awesome, 2K, 538ppi crisp screen. Videos and images in proper high resolution almost pop out. Colors are really natural unlike S6 which due to OLED even though are sharp but colors are a little saturated. I like true to life colors, not overblown. I played ""n"" number of videos and images and shared with friends and family, they all had 1 thing to say - They have never seen such a beautiful display. This comment also comes from an S6 owner himself who is a die hard fan of Samsung and hardly praises other products. Camera : I don't want to go gaga over camera, just want to say one thing to pass on the message - ""The Best"". Almost everything from 4K Videos at 30 FPS to ultra-sharp day and night images that too in RAW. You really have to experience it, even the selfie camera for that matter. Some say S6 currently has the best Camera. I somewhat agree, I think LG is better. Daily Usage / Speed / Practical usability : LG UX is not extremely refined like the one Samsung did with S6, but is un-interruptive, slick, super-fast. I have never, never, never seen slightest lag in switching apps / games or working around. Also, the device stays cool even on heavy gaming due to leather backing. Glass is a good conductor of heat and got real warm in some devices. The built in mono speaker is good / loud enough in chatter crowd, though I always prefer to listen to Hi-Fi music which this phone supports through headphones. The call quality is as expected, loud and clear (Almost bass emphasized like Nokia - which is really good as the voice feels a lot natural) through the ear-speaker even in weak network with the person on other side able to hear me without any issues. The phone also supports fast charging - Yes its true : 60% in 30 Minutes. Updates : LG did release initial patch for some speed updates and overall android bug patching, though this device will get Android ""M"" update in few months, skipping all the frequent ""L"" patches. I don't think its a major issue for me at least as the device runs pretty smooth. Sort of long review, but all I want to say that with my 2 weeks of experience with this device, I am almost certain to have it as my primary daily driver. A practical performer with timeless beauty. All I now want from LG in next version is some sort of Water / Dust resistant body, but truly the LG G4 is one superb smartphone to come in a long time. read more ? 16 users found this review helpful helpful?","09 Sep 2015,"

Asus Zenfone Selfie,4 stars,Asus Zenfone Selfie one of the best in the series,"The phone was delivered well in time from Flipkart unlike last time thanks to Flipkart, phone is very well packed and neat. I am writing this review after using this phone for one week. First thing comes to mind when you think of this phone is its weight it much lighter in weight and easier to hold in hand, its 5.5 inch corning gorilla glass 4 is a surprise, video quality in HD is awesome, phone has 1.7 Ghz Octa core processor which does its work pretty well, 2 GB RAM is quite suffice for all the needs, Call quality is good no drops found. Coming to the important thing the Battery, the 3000 MAH battery lives through the day without any draining issues, Camera is excellent, picture quality is perfect with 13 MP Rear as well as Front does the job well, the laser focus is a added feature and is the only phone which comes with a 13 MP front camera. Asus has refined a lot of things in its models and this phone is really a stunner and worth buying. 7 users found this review helpful helpful?","20 Oct 2015,"

Bad signal reception, voice breaks over calls. 1k phones will give you better call quality than this one. 2. Phone seems to be changing voice pitch and other voice aspects a lot. Unable to recognize even a well know persons voice. 3. Back cover looks cheap and fragile. Go for it if you want to experiment with your first smart phone and when you need all features that a middle level budget phone(ranging around 8k) can give you and when you are not too concerned about the voice clarity and call quality. 5 users found this review helpful helpful?","28 May 2015,"

Salora Njoy X E7,5 stars,"Good Battery Backup, awesome phone, totally indispensable Phone at this Price","I was looking for a secondary phone, which must have good battery life. Since I expect this as secondary phone therefore I wasn't much concerned about specificaions but believe me, it's an amazing phone by ever trusted brand Salora. No lagging - smooth User Interface.

Salora Njoy X E7,1 stars,Waste of money,"Don't buy this phone. Waste of money. I could not find any service centre of Salora. Though I found few contact numbers on Google but no one was there to answer to my calls, I did not like the customer service by Salora. If there is any issue, who can't get the phone repaired. The phone may look good, but there is no service, the electronic device will have some issues in usage for all devices. But if there is no service center, what is the use. So think 100 times before buying any of the Salora products. I feel that we are wasting our money by buying these Salora products, who don't have any ethics and there intend is to sell and go away as a street sellers. 2 users found this review helpful helpful?","04 Feb 2016,"

Videocon Infinium Zest Flame,3 stars,Good backup phone,"Gave it as a gift, well actually was on a tight budget. This phone is being used by the lady as a backup phone for her children back home and doubles up as a good enough music player.

An external memory card can easily solve this without much expense (365/- for 16 GB). Battery is an issue though not a major one. Overall a recommended low-cost option with most smartphone features.

What is Good- 1-Camera quality in day light is very good. 2-No lags while playing games and internet, 3G works fine. 3-Decent Look. Overall it's budget phone!!! Think & Go!!!

Rage Yo,4 stars,"My finnal verdict, even though the Cons are major but in 299 I think it's an average phone","Lucky me! I got this phone in just 299/- on the Great Indian Freedom Sale, and at a price at this it is one of it's kind. Well to be honest, I though this phone's would be same size for any Basic Phone but it's size is smaller then expected, not much but you can actually hide it just in your palms. And it's actually MADE IN INDIA!!! Well getting on with the phone's performance, Pros: * It has actually 800maH battery, although its made by Raga, but still it's 800maH * It has music player, but speakers distorts the sound but it's okay in 300 bucks. * It also has Image viewer, Video player, Sound recorder and FM radio, in Multimedia Section. * It also has a memory to hold 500 contacts in the phone. * And in tools it has Alarm (with 3 timings), Calender, Bluetooth, Calculator, World Clock, and to my surprise it also has a LED torch light. * And in terms of Setting configuration, its pretty basic, Call Settings, Phone settings, Display settings, Security Settings, Network Settings and Profiles. * It also have a memory card slot, I tried 8GB class 4 and its working fine. * And one last thing, it also have a Icon for ""Raga Treasure Box"", which contains Blacklist and Auto Call recording. Cons: * The major disappointment is that its MRP is 900/- but has a distinctive look of a Toy phone due to its plastic body, which is very fragile and if you hold it tightly it might get crushed. * It doesn't have any GAMES, it only has a single game of Ninja UP, which sucks by the way and it only has 5 trials and after that you have to BUY it, WTF, who would buy a GAME in this thing. * And it doesn't have any functionality for the differentiation with regards to the SIM management, and if your planning to use this as a Basic phones with Dual SIM, I request you to please look other options. read more ? 7 users found this review helpful helpful?","18 Aug 2015,"

Karbonn Titanium S320,3 stars,Average Phone,"When I purchased this phone I did not find any review. So here is my review for buyers. After long search with my needs I found this product under my budget. But few things you have to note before buying. Positive: 1. The display quality is very bright and also good in this price. 2. Touch sensitivity is not so smooth, it is average. 3. Sound quality during call, Speaker phone and Media play is very good. But supplied headphone is worst. 4. Aswom look. Back cover is mat type that makes well grip in hand. 5. Many features has introduced in this kitkat version. Menu item looks good. 6. Camera is very good. This is first time I found a well camera from Karbonn as well as non authentic brands. Auto focus, Duel LED flash, High quality secondary camera, Smile detection, HDR, Full HD recording (1920 x 1080), Panorama and Face Beauty mode are its well features. But there is no ISO selecting. Front camera also has auto focus. 7. Battery is very good. It is 3000 mAh and enough for this phone. Negative: 1. It uses Mediatek CPU that is not so good. 2. It has problem in GPS and G-Sensor receiving . It can not catch the signals any where . I came to know that this is a common problem from MediateK CUP and sensors. Karbonn has not fixed this problem. I frequently use offline and online maps, but this disappointed me. My problem will not be solved by the servicing center until it rooted. 3. Other sensor is average. 4. Product seal is worst. It is one sided seal. It can be easily open without cutting the seal of the product. This can be misused Extra Specification Note: 1. CPU- MT6582, 1.3 GHz 2. Cores- 4 3.

Panasonic Eluga L 4G,3 stars,"Good phone with attractive price tag, but I am facing few issues","I have purchased this phone 3 to 4 weeks back. I like the sleek design of the phone and features provided and very attractive price tag. I have been using this from the last 2 to 3 weeks and came across below issues. Contacted the Panasonic customer support and waiting for a response from them. Wanted to share the information for the benefit of other users who might be planning to buy the phone :) ISSUE# 1: When the signal is week and gets lost while on the call (Both my signal or the signal of the person whom I am speaking with) my phone is hanging and resetting/restarting automatically ISSUE# 2: While I am speaking on phone at times (~ 4 to 5 times a day) I am seeing a message that ""SD card is removed un expectedly, please un-mount the card before removing to avoid any loss of data"". Once the call is completed the SD card is auto detected and error message disappears. But, I will not be able to access the applications that are moved to the SD Card (Message ""APP IS NOT INSTALLED"" will display when I try to access the apps moved to SD card). I need to restart my mobile to Fix the issue and access the applications again. 12 users found this review helpful helpful?","17 Jun 2015,"

Intex Aqua A2,4 stars,Unassuming Yet Efficient & Smooth,"I bought the Aqua A2 on Oct 27, 2015 from this Amazon page. I got the blue color model(see the pics). The accessories provided were charger, headphones, USB cable, user manual, warranty card, invoice, case cover and screen protection. I bought this mainly for a little more internal memory compared to my earlier phone. Since it's been only a day, I cannot provide a detailed opinion, nevertheless I must say it's been really good so far. I'll will update my review with more usage of the phone. Pros: -- The blue back cover(seems prussian blue) looks good and feels smooth to the touch. -- The touch is really smooth. -- Battery has been decent so far. ***NOTE*** The battery is removable. Couple of mobile review sites provide wrong info that it is non-removable. -- Internal memory available is nearly 5.85GB. -- Has Quickoffice(word, excel & powerpoint) that can be handy. -- The flash is good and I got a decent, close up selfie using the front cam. Yet to test the rear cam. There is video and panorama mode available. Cons: -- I've noticed that apps shortcuts on the home screen occasionally disappear after I transfer any media between PC & mobile! But I think this is more of an android issue as I read other brands too facing similar hiccups and occurs mainly on apps that I moved to SD card. -- The case cover provided as accessory is tough to remove once the phone is in. Rather than risk damaging your phone trying to pull it out from the cover, I suggest you buy more easier to use flip covers made especially for this phone and available on Amazon, or check out my reviews on the same. For the price, I think this mobile is very good value for money - unassuming looks yet reflects quality in function & design.

Samsung Galaxy J5,1 stars,a mediocre phone,"To retain its top position in indian market samsung(presently holding approx 21% while micromax at 19%) was in need to launch a good handset with price within 10k. When lenovo, xiaomi,motorola are offering high value for money phones,samsung again launched a phone with same old design and at price of Rs.11999 (+1= Rs 12000.00) through flipkart only.And its about 10 days passed by, after its official launch in delhi on 16th july,till now none is lucky to get it in hand.Why they took this strategy to falsely increase the demand? Samsung should make it available in open retail shops immediately or people will loss interest in it. Moreover after some 1 months of online selling,this will come to offline market with little high price and then after 4-5 months it will go much down ! please samsung grow up ! You are not making us(customers) obliged by selling phones................... now we have much more options in hand.Motorola moto G 3rd gen will be a much more good option at same price range.Be courageous try other phones and dont spend your hard earned money after samsung.............. let samsung compete to satisfy customers. Pros 4 G super amoled screen in indian variation Android 5.1.1 OS 13 MP primary camera and front flash with 5MP in front Its okay with 294 ppi Cons Same monotonous old looks Highly priced must be under Rs.10,000.00 RAM is 1.5 which should be 2 GB ROM is 8 GB but should be 16 GB Processor is 1.2 GHz but should be 1.7.

No hanging issue during games. Camera quality is superb 13 mp rear and 5mp front both are excellent. Battery backup is also good. This phone is slim and light weight so user experience is excellent. I m happy to bought this product. IMPORTANT NOTE: 1, First of all check the IMEI number of your phone which one you have bought from Flipkart or any other sites. Check your IMEI number which is in box with thiis code. If both are same then there is no problem with the phone. Here is IMEI checking number: *#06#.

Intex Aqua Power Plus,1 stars,Buy only to get Worst after sale service,"Initially you find it as a good phone, in just 2 months problem starts cropping up, when you give it to service center they forward it to factory, and then your real struggle for getting your phone back starts. It takes atleast atleast 2 - 3 months to get the phone and that too a replacement of lower value phone. Ultimately what you think a economical phone is no more remain economical. They are using this trick to cheat customers. I am very disappointed with Intex Service Center. I am giving 1 star, because there is nothing lower than that. 31 users found this review helpful helpful?","21 Jun 2015,"

Philips E160,5 stars,Best feature phone i have used.,"Simple phone with good features. Looks good and solid with a large Screen. All menu items can be seen in one screen. Phone is also bigger than other phones with similar features and sound clarity is better than all other phones i have used.Charger is same as smartphone charger. Nothing much to expect from a camera in a basic phone. When i purchased this phone there were no reviews, but having faith in Philips products , i went ahead and purchased it. I am happy that Philips lived up to their reputation. There maybe some cons but since it is just 2 days since i have purchased it , i have not yet found any. Amazon price is slightly higher than others. ( I have not purchased this from Amazon ). 3 users found this review helpful helpful?","13 Jul 2015,"

Philips E160,5 stars,Worth the price,"Good delivery by amazon - ordered on 14-02-2016 and got it on 16-02-2016. The phone is exactly as described and perfect in its looks and ease of use. I saw in some reviews that this phone does not have bluetooth. - NO- THIS PHONE HAS BLUETOOTH. I even came to see that someone wrote this mobile does not allow usb connection to computer - NO- THIS PHONE CONNECTS TO PC LIKE A CHARM. This phone also comes with call recorder option which you have to set in settings - Our voice is a bit lower than recipients voice - No worries - Works well. Camera, Music Player and video player are not good - BUT WHO CARES FOR THOSE IN BUDGET PHONES. Battery is the biggest asset for the mobile - 1600 MAH does not disappoint. Call Quality is exceptional - Good signal reception - I checked it in my cellar parking area and 5 stars for signal reception. Phone book capacity is limited - 500 contacts only - Look for that for those who have more contacts like me. Speaker volume is decent and even there is no crackling sound in high volumes. Looks of this phone is awesome - You can't get better than this. Pricing is very decent and the phone is very easy to use and have minimal options which do not confuse elder people even. Those who are looking for a phone in the range below 2000, go for it. It will not dissappoint you. read more ? 1 users found this review helpful helpful?","16 Feb 2016,"

Swipe Konnect ME,4 stars,Good Phone,"After long search I buy this phone under Rs. 4000. This is a good phone under my budget. Buying 13 various mobile phone from online form last 3 years, here I am giving this phone 7 out of 10. Good: 1. Back cover is mat-type, rubber finished which makes well grip. 2. Display brightness is very good. 3. Battery is very good in this price. 4. Front camera is very good 5. It did not blocked beautiful features of Kitkat OS. 7. No heating. 8. Light weight. Drawback: 1. Display pixel is not good. Out look is very bad. Casing looks like a toy. 2. Speaker is not good. Sound during call is low. Headphone is worst. 3. Back camera is not good. 4. Network signal receiving and GPS receiving is very bad. Expected more because this the basic thing of a mobile phone. It has problem in 3G connectivity. After using internet for few times, it stops receiving data. 5. Touch is not good Verdict: For frequent phone calling, internet surfing and game playing, this phone is the best one. I will give 4.5 out of 5. This is the first time I am giving a phone 4.5 points. If it has no network problem I will give it 5 out of 5. 2 users found this review helpful helpful?","22 Sep 2015,"

Micromax Canvas Knight 2 4G,1 stars,"Lousy battery, keeps hanging, unreliable.","Please do not buy this phone. I've been using the Canvas Knight2 since ten months, and I've regretted buying the phone every single day. I spent Rs.16K on this phone (didn't buy it through Amazon), and it turned to be a bad investment. I should have bought a Samsung or Xiaomi, at a much lower price. I also have a Samsung J1 Ace that cost me just Rs.6000/-, and that's a much better phone, although Canvas Knight has impressive specs on paper. But only on paper. The main issue with the Canvas Knight 2 is its lousy battery life. Even on power saver mode, with all the apps turned off, the battery does not last more than ten hours - if I do not use the phone AT ALL. If I use it sparingly, only for calls and nothing else, the battery life does not exceed six hours. Even on power-saver mode, without using the phone at all, I still have to charge it twice a day. I dare not switch off the phone, because it always hangs when I switch it back on. Even during regular use, it hangs without warning. Outgoing calls are almost impossible, because the default dialer app keeps hanging. The Canvas Knight2 is the most expensive paperweight I have ever bought - because I cannot use it for anything else. For the same price, or less, you can get good models from Samsung or Xiaomi. read more ? 8 users found this review helpful helpful?","09 May 2016,"

OK now about this phone - What in the Box - The Blu win LTE - Phone Ear Phones USB charging cable (But no charger) Screen Guard Plastic Case Some useless booklet which mentions help number A quick guide leaflet The Phone itself. The phone is a nice Feature packed little phone. Dual Sim 4G Support! Windows 8.1 4.5"" IPS Screen (480x854) Snapdragon 410 (Quad core 1.2Ghz) 64 Bit CPU Adreno 306 GPU Which is good enough for mild gaming. 8GB Storage + Option for MicroSD card - Up to 64GB 1GB RAM 5MP Camera with Flash Front VGA camera Phone doesn t feel laggy at all. Starts well a quick setup and the phone is ready. Unlike Entry level Android phones windows phone does not hang or reboot. Very Stable from the Box, Not much bloatware installed. Just the some Amazon App installed, blu help came pre-installed. Very light weight phone. Phone has Dedicated Hard ware Buttons under the screen at the bottom and not software keys built into the display like the Lumia 535 and some of the newer Microsoft phones. This helps by giving you the full Display area - These Buttons are all backlit! good Sound Quality. Sides are metal finished, backside is plastic. The back plate is flimsy plastic. 2000Mah Battery. Which lasts long on a small phone like this. Oh wait did I mention this phone has Cortana?! Phone doesn t feel laggy at all. Starts well a quick setup and the phone is ready.

Which lasts long on a small phone like this. Oh wait did I mention this phone has Cortana?! What I don t like about this phone - Camera Quality is Average at best. Even though it says 5MP camera the picture quality isn t that great. During day time you can expect decent pictures but at night the picture quality is just bad. Screen Quality is Average at best, Low screen resolution. Loud Speaker Volume is low compared to other phones Headphone Quality is again Below Average. Sounds like some cheap Chinese headphones. Phone has inbuilt Battery which will not allow users to replace the battery. Bottom line - Very good phone at this price range. If you are on a tight budget and are looking for a phone that is feature packed and wont randomly boot down or restart, this is the phone for you, I Fully Recommend this phone. read more ? 59 users found this review helpful helpful?","16 Oct 2015,"

Huawei Honor 4C,5 stars,CAMERA and Everything for Rs.8999 is GREAT.,"If you are budget and CAMERA specific, then this one is for you.(UPDATED 15.10.2015) Camera :- Rear 13MP has 1/3.06"" sensor from Sony (IMX 214), which gives good results than Any other phone(like Lenovo A6000,6000plus,7000 etc) in this price range. Full HD videos are crystal clear without any staggering@30fps and photos in low light are good too. Videos are recorded in MP4 format and not 3gp which is a great advantage. People should be aware of the IMAGE SENSOR SIZE and NOT the MEGAPIXEL factor. Front camera is a fixed focus camera with 1/4"" sensor from OmniVision(OV5648). you can take Beautiful HD(720p) videos without any staggering @ 30fps in MP4 format ( 99percent of mobiles with price range of Rs.12-13k perform poor with low fps and they do stagger). 5MP is great with clear details. Beauty mode kills the originality, so kindly use normal photo mode. Selfies won't disappoint you. - Battery hardly lasts only for a day on an above normal usage. And 100 percent comes to 83 percent overnight in standby. May be because of Octa-Cores eating the battery. Honor is spoiling the brand name of Huawei with this one phone.....You can Foresee (4c). The other features of the phone will make you forget the battery. Battery is A issue but you will get used to it, until Huawei makes an update to solve it. - Lollipop Update available, which( both Beta B302 and B330 version) also eats the battery like the KitKat. No point in updating. KitKat update with ""Firmware/Software of Honor 4C with improved battery performance"" is available in Pakistan Huawei Website and it will not work for us. Google search for the words within ""------"", you will come to know. Latest KitKat update from Huawei India website is a bit more stable than the one which is available at honor India website . No point, it also eats the battery. Compatible KitKat Firmware versions for Indian Honor 4C so far released are battery eaters (B063, B070, B130-available at Vietnam site). - User Interface EMUI 3.0 is very simple, basic and very Easy to use. - Touch is Silky Smooth with ultra-fast response. - NO 60fps or 120fps recording in camera - Call quality is excellent. Speaker phone is OK, loud and above average or better than Honor Holly. If you want a blasting sound speaker phone then this will not suit you. - Display is absolutely great and far far better than Lenovo A6000 plus. - 2GB RAM is great and about 1.27Gb is free all the time - 64 Bit, 8 Core processor eats any game with ease and it is 2x faster than quad-core snapdragons in all aspects. - Continuous gaming and usage warms the phone. Heat is bearable and not as hot as iphone or samsung. - in-built phone manager app clears the junk and cache, whenever needed and background running apps can be controlled via phone manager app - Package comes with Screen Guard and charger kit. NO ear phones. - Dual Micro-SIM, Both are 3G and NO 4G in this version(4G is related to hardware of the phone and is NOT software specific. No 4G is absolutely no 4G). Net connectivity is superb. - Internet access is good - USB OTG function is available !!!!! - 3.38 GB available on board. Top it up with an external memory(32GB Available) card of 16GB class 10 from Transcend or Sandisk. If the battery issue is solved, You won't look upon other upcoming phones for the next two years at-least. HUAWEI means ""Just buy it. It won't let you down""(for the price you are paying) but to honor the 4c, better go for Honor 4x(you won't regret and i have that too) Everything for the price of Rs.8999 is GREAT. Product delivered in just two days.Thankyou Flipkart. read more ? 98 users found this review helpful helpful?","12 May 2015,"
Huawei Honor 4C,1 stars,Typical chinese product,"I purchased this phone on 10th May and received it on 12th and here's my review of the phone - This phone is packed with great features for the price, no doubt about it. However, the problem is with the battery. I used the phone with 2G network, zero brightness and minimal calls. Absolutely no gaming/facebook/camera usage/GPS usage. They claim the battery to be 2550mAh but it doesn't even last for 10 hours with minimal usage! I had to charge the phone twice a day. I requested for a replacement and flipkart promptly replaced the product without any questions asked. I received the new piece on 20th May and it was the same issue with the new piece too. Additionally, there was another issue - a yellow patch on the bottom of the screen. The patch was uniform - about 1 cm from the bottom of the screen hence I requested for replacement again. And now the phone is completely DEAD. All I did was I turned on the Alarm and went to bed. The next day I woke up and the phone was completely dead. I tried the hard reset but no use. So guys, please think twice before buying this phone. 72 users found this review helpful helpful?","27 May 2015,"

Huawei Honor 4C,5 stars,How to fix the battery drain issue and in review of the phone in short.,"Battery draining issue could be solved by these steps. 1: Update all your apps after receiving the phone. 2. Clear partition cache after updating the apps. 3: Go to Settings>Manage apps>All>Google Search>Force stop the app and then disable it. 4: Restart the phone. 5. Leave your phone for few hours and you'll notice that the battery drain issue is fixed. ***How to clear partition cache*** >Switch of your phone. >Hold volume up and power key at the same time. Leave the keys ONLY AFTER THE HONOR LOGO APPEARS (Important) >Use the volume keys to navigate and go to the last option ""Wipe Cache Partition"" and use the power key to select it. >After the process is complete use the power key to select reboot. (Wiping the partition cache is absolutely safe and won't delete any data from your phone) Now coming on to the phone, this is the best smartphone you can buy under 10k, PERIOD! The phone looks great, will give you the premium feeling of a 30k phone. It is very well built with no creaking sound present anywhere. The display quality is great, the icons pop out on the screen and watching pictures and movies on it is a treat. There's no screen protection but they provide a good quality screen guard in the box so its not a problem. The performance of the phone is amazing with no lag whatsoever. I've played high end games like MC5, Asphalt 8 and Nova 3 on highest graphics setting and have never experienced any lag. There are some frame drops some times but nothing you can't live without. The UI is very good with lots of customization features. I've fallen in love with the Magazine unlock which changes the lockscreen wallpaper every time I unlock the phone. The camera is the best in this price range. Pictures taken in outdoor conditions have lots of detail and colours come out amazingly good. In normal indoor conditions the pictures are very good too and in really low light they're still very much usable with very low visible noise. There are lots of feature like All-Focus and Watermark which come out handy in different scenarios.The only thing I'm not happy with is the flash, it is not as powerful as it should have been. Battery is very good if you do what I said previously in the review. I get around 6 and a half hour of on screen time spread around a whole day with facebook, browsing internet, whatsapp, taking few pictures and a little bit of gaming. A lot of you must be confused between Lenovo A7000, Yu Yureka and Honor 4c like I was few days back. Just go for Honor 4c, you won't regret the choice. read more ? 53 users found this review helpful helpful?","02 Jun 2015,"

BLU Win HD LTE,5 stars,Truely great phone. REMAX charger is pathertic.,"I think this mobile deserves a big time recognition cos for the specs and the price this has been a dream come true for many people. I did not think twice before I bought this mobile cos I was comparing the hardware details with Microsoft Lumia 550. Microsoft Lumia has snapdragon 210, 1 gb ram and adreno 304. I think it has gorilla glass protection but I'm not sure. BLU WIN HD has Snapdragon 410 , 1GB ram and Adreno 306. The only worry is that this mobile doesn't have gorilla glass., But this comes with a screen protector and silicon case in the box. Which gives gud protection to the mobile and I'm pleased with it. Please use some good charger cos this mobile doesn't come with a charger in the box and Amazon is giving Remax charger free. Seriously Remax charger is super pathetic cos it takes almost 6 to 8 hours to charge this mobile. I can give one start less for not having charger in the box but I cannot reduce the star cos this mobile is seriously awesome. ****Edited: 21.10.2015: 11:15am The battery back up is good once I started using different charger than using the REMAX provided by amazon. If you contact the local Authorized BLU service center they will help you to buy a original charger for approx. $12(RS:750). If you use any other charger please make sure the output voltage is not more than 5V otherwise you will spoil ur handset. I used games like shadow fight 2 and tekkan, spiderman. I found the mobile lags when you use high resolution background. Since this being 720 hd screen you cannot use high resolution seamlessly. But once I change the settings the games work perfectly and seamlessly ( I'm enjoying it). The camera quality is ok for 8 MP and honestly this is gud for everyday usage. The immediate difference you can find from Lumia mobiles and BLU is the APPS. You cannot work any of the LUMIA apps like LUMIA camera, LUMIA smartshooter, mixradio, here maps. They don't work in this mobile.. Still there are other apps similar and you will not feel like missing a lot. Windows store in 8.1 is not very big because they are all migrating to windows 10 store and also developers are creating universal apps so that you can use one single app for multiple devices like WIndows desktop, laptop mobile and xbox. I think the app store will make huge progress from 2016 onwards. But you can find lot of utility apps and xbox games in the store. Overall this mobile is a sure winner and must buy phone. read more ? 28 users found this review helpful helpful?","19 Oct 2015,"

Micromax Canvas Play,4 stars,Overall a good phone with such a low budget,"Overall a good phone with such a low budget. Here you get 8 GB internal memory with 1 GB RAM. Further you get 5.5"" Display Phone with a butter smooth touch along with latest android version ' Lollipip ' which is of very fast processor compared to ' Kitkat '. Display quality is so so because neither its superamoled nor with gorilla protection but you will see lightening speed in internet browsing and downloading. Sound quality is very good compared to Samsung models i.e. Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 etc. Only cons. is that its camera, which is poor compared to other same 5MP samsung phone camera. Secondly body look is not like smart, strong and gorgeos as samsung models. Thirdly, it has no direct video calling provision with such a heavy features for which I feel very sad. Because direct video calling and skype video calling has vast difference.If these drawbacks were meet up along with 1.5 GB RAM than it will be a super duper hit and nothing else is expected. 4 users found this review helpful helpful?","30 Apr 2015,"

HTC One M9 Plus,5 stars,People crying out loud for its bad camera performance should try it again after the firmware ...,"Just bought the M9+ from a nearby retail store and loving it so far. I am not someone who plays games on phones but this MediaTek processor is not a slouch. Any current generation high end processor will be enough to perform day to day tasks without a hitch and I am someone who believes that we dont need gazillion cores to use a phone. People crying out loud for its bad camera performance should try it again after the firmware update. The Autofocus is improved considerably and it takes fine pictures now. You can play with manual settings to adjust the shutter speed and ISO levels to get a perfect looking low light shot. Let me give you a short background about where I come from. I bought the S6 on the launch day itself and faced the infamous pink tint issue on the screen. Got DOA done from the service center and the replacement device turned out to be worse than the original unit. Sold the hideous phone at a loss of INR 9k. So much for the so called Samsung flagship! Look at the general thread of S6 on XDA, people are crying all over this pink tint issue. Then came the iPhone, the so called God of all phones (BULLS**T!). Got the 64gb version and again ran into an infamous issue faced by many iPhone users. The screen was literally popping out of the metal casing right out of the box and made clicking sounds while typing messages. While Apple is busy milking huge profits out of customers, the least I expected was stringent quality control. Apple users make fun of companies like OnePlus and dont realize that their iPhone may have been manufactured right next door in China. I am a happy camper after today's purchase since everything seems to be perfect build wise on HTC and its the best I've used till date, quality wise. This comes from a person who has used flagships after flagships since 2011. Unless you aren't bothered about development and are not into custom ROM's, M9+ is a good buy and I would highly recommend it. If you are someone who cares about custom ROM's and a spanking camera on the phone, this one's not for you. This is the most underestimated phone amongst current flagships and I would highly recommend it to anyone to cares about experience rather than benchmarks or names like Qualcomm. Qualcomm seriously messed up with their SD 810 in a hurry to bring out a 64 bit SOC. read more ? 40 users found this review helpful helpful?","21 May 2015,"

The phone looks great, looks sleek and trendy.I bought the one with a white back cover (Just like my Honor Holly). The phone comes with a USB charger nothing else(no headphones). You should not expect it though given that they did not provide it for the Honor Holly either. No complaints given the price, the specs are great. 1 GB Ram is critical to run many of my everyday apps.The screen quality is excellent, displays are very sharp. The navigation is smooth, with absolutely no lag. The battery seems to be holding up pretty well (Can't comment, just got it this afternoon :) ) I got a Rs500 discount for my credit card. For a price of Rs4,500/-, this phone is a steal. Go for it! Adding more feedback. The picture quality on the primary camera is excellent given that it is a 8MP camera. The secondary camera (2MP) for selfie shots are decent too(Not fantastic, though). The battery life is decent, last for a day with normal useage (means no gaming). My aunt recently bought a micromax yureka yu for about 9K. The display of Honor Bee is distinctly superior to the micromax yureka phone. Overall very happy with the performance of the phone. I am not a gamer so, no gaming feedback! Adding more feedback: People in the reviews, generally complain about the battery, that it drains fast. Initially yes, it drains fast for the first 2-3 days (don't know why). I would suggest installing ""Battery doctor Du"" app. It has a trickle stage charging for extended battery life. Ever since, the battery is holding up pretty well. No complaints! Bottomline: Strongly recommend Honor Bee. read more ? 68 users found this review helpful helpful?","13 May 2015,"

HTC One E9 Plus,1 stars,"Flipkart Late delivery , Received defective Mobile for HTC E9 Plus Rs. 35000","I have purchased a New HTC E9+ Plus Mobile from Flipkart .com of Rs.34, 999/- on 22-06-2015 Firstly i have paid extra for their express next day delivery. but i have received the mobile after 2 days. When i have asked to return to refund my extra monEy, they ""DENIED"". After receiving the mobile, the mobile charger was found not working - DEFECTIVE. I went to HTC service as per Suggested by Flipkart Customer care person 2 times. But HTC service center has DENIED to take the mobile as it was purchased from FLIPKART & NOT FROM A DEALER. When i have highlighted the Issue with FLIPKART customer care person on the same day (11-07-2015) they told me that i will resolve the issue by 15-07-2015. On 13-07-2015, i received a call from FLIPKART executive stating that FLIPKART WILL TAKE BACK THE MOBILE WITH IN 3 DAY & REFUND ME THE MONEY AFTER 8 WORKING DAYS IN MY ACCOUNT. . I HAVE ALREADY PAID HUGE AMOUNT ON TEMPERED GLASS & BACK COVER FOR THE MOBILE. ALSO IT IS A BIG HARASSMENT FOR ME AFTER BUYING SUCH PREMIUM PHONE. I AM FACING A BIG HARASSMENT FOR LAST 20 DAYS & UNABLE TO USE TO PROPERLY FOR WHICH I HAVE PAID A HUGE AMOUNT. HIGHLY RECOMMENCED NOT TO PURCHASE FROM FLIPKART. 49 users found this review helpful helpful?","13 Jul 2015,"
HTC One E9 Plus,5 stars,HTC One E9 will beat even the higher budget phones on features and performance,"This review is after 4 days use of the device. First of all the outer look will beat any phone in the market, sleek, appropriately combined with colors (Gold Sepia looks the best). Display is very vibrant and everything appears real in the screen. Second comes the Camera. No doubt a 20 MP camera does all the wonders required on daily life. Even there are certain modes which are available on DSLR cameras only. Third comes the battery. 2800 MAH battery is enough for full day use even if you are a hardcore mobile user. Here are my own examples- Day 1:- Received in the evening a 5 PM and when opened, the battery was 58 %. I switched on the phone, configured it with Wi-Fi and used continuously up to 10 PM via Wi-Fi only downloading the apps, doing personalization and transferring all the things from old phone and the battery left at 10 PM was 21 %. Day-2:- Fully charged previous night and the battery remaining in the morning was 89 % then I started the day again at 8 AM with the same curiosity things on a new phone and kept 3G on permanently for whole day and using Whatsapp, Facebook, net surfing and at the end of the day at 5 PM, the battery remaining was 39% which lasted for whole night and needed charging in the morning. Day-3:- started with 100 % battery at 7 AM and installed about 100 apps and configured all of them, watched videos, taken pictures, whatsapp was permanently on and 3G was also permanently on. Made my own themes and did various things not allowing the screen to be off even for a second i.e. used it continuously for 5 hours doing all the things and screen was kept open for 5 hours continuously without a blink of screen. Any other phone would have begged for charging and would have heated up to boiling point but this one left with 27 % battery and cool like was kept in AC. All these things were apart from the calls I received and dialed which is average 40 calls before noon and 40 after noon. P.S. :- If you switch off data connection, you ll wonder from where it s operating i.e. battery is almost not at all used. I don t think anyone would require more rigorous use of phone than this. So you can be sure of battery lasting the day long irrespective of your field. The features don t need to be told as are already mentioned. Yes corrections are as below- 1. It s a dual SIM phone not a single SIM 2. SD card support is up to 2 TB and not only 128 GB 3. The weight of the phone is 135 gm and not 150 gm All these features are not available even on high budget phones up to 55 K so you should grab it for sure. Cons:- 1. The phone is large in size and its because the bezel is much more. The size can be reduced by almost an Inch if HTC would have designed it precisely. 2. User Interface is not as much appealing as is in Samsung premium phones and LG premium phones. I was using LG G2 and I will still declare it a winner over E9+ on inner appearance of the phone. 3. HTC is giving a charger with 1 AMP adapter which will require about 2 and half hours to charge the phone to full. They should have given at least 2 AMP so that charging time could have been reduced to half. Overall it s a treat on 35 K. You won t get such features in this budget and that too from a renowned company like HTC. So don t think, just go for it. read more ? 30 users found this review helpful helpful?","23 Jun 2015,"

Lenovo K3 Note,4 stars,Just Got This Phone Yesterday,"Hi, i ordered this phone from alibaba dot com on the 22nd of april 2015. the price is not so cheap actually. after paying the customs charges, it cost me around I.N.R. 14500. overall it is a good phone. i would still suggest everyone to wait till the phone is launched in india and not to order it from china as most of the sellers on alibaba dot com are fraud. Moreover you will also face difficulty translating chinese into english. Pros The processor works fine. Battery is decent. touch is good. i have bought 2 phones, 1 yellow and 1 white. white one is more beautiful. the phone is sleek and looks good. Cons Camera quality is not as good as a 13 mp camera. if you zoom in the pic, you will realize it yourself. the sound from the speaker is very low, so if you want to listen to music, you need earphones or headphones (which is not there in the accessories). the 322 users found this review helpful helpful?","20 May 2015,"

Microsoft Lumia 430 Dual SIM,5 stars,great phone,"Purchased Lumia 430 a week ago at Reliance Digital, Kamananahalli, Bangalore ! ( not that i dont trust Amazon service ) , At this price this phone is a super deal, here are the Pros and Cons : Pros : 1) Looks good in hand 2) The plastic back case is not at all cheap , looks and feels pretty decent 3) Screen Clearity is good ( way better than karbon or micromaxx phones at this price range ) 4) 1GB Ram really does the job , phones operates smooth absolutely no lag whatso ever & 8GB of memory 5) Touch is very much responsive 6) Battery back up seems good ( should last one day ) 7) Tried Subway surfer, temple run2 , candy crush , Hill climb and 3D chess (absolutely no lag at all ) 8) Amazing call voice clearity at both ends ! Cons : I would not be writing any points here considering the price range , but yes there are flaws which i noticed 1) no flash 2) camera picture quality is just Ok in daylight , but a big no no in the night , goes same with the front camera ( but you should still be able to make skype calls ) 3) not a con but yes keep those micro sims ready if you currently have a normal sized sim card 4) thinking hard to figure out more points , sadly not able to ... Bottom line : At this price of 5k from a good and trusted brand like Nokia/Microsoft this product which can accomodate all the vital apps like whatsapp, viber, true caller, skype (simply download them all from windows store) etc etc what more do you need !!! Just go for it if you are on a limited budget or wanna gift it to your mom, younger sis/bro in college ( you know what i mean ;) read more ? 30 users found this review helpful helpful?","04 Jun 2015,"
Microsoft Lumia 430 Dual SIM,4 stars,Decent for the price tag,"This is, as of now, the cheapest Lumia Phone to hit the market. Yes a few sacrifices have to be made to make it just about Rs 5150. But that doesn't mean poor quality. Or bad functioning. In fact this phone's specifications are pretty much better than what we're used to. It is a 4 inch phone with an agreeably sharp resolution of 800 480. Sharp because it is on a 4 inch. Sadly the display enhancement technologies like ClearBlack are not available. Ambient Light and Proximity Sensors have been included meaning Auto Brightness will work here. The phone has a storage capacity of 8GB which is expandable to 128GB with an external SD card. The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 SoC, with dual 1.2 GHz Cortex A7 cores. This is good since Windows Phone OS is good with low end devices in terms of speed unlike on Android. One will be able to access the whole Windows Store of Applications as this phone has 1GB RAM. The main camera sadly is just 2MP while the front camera 0.3MP. This are the major drawbacks of this phone. A 5MP camera would be better Microsoft. The phone comes with a 1500mAh battery which is also too low for most users nowadays. Opinion : Is this a good phone? Yes. Would I buy it if I wanted a low end Windows Phone? No. Why? Because there is the Lumia 535 which beats this phone in everything and I'll only have to add a few thousands. But if one can't afford the Lumia 535, then this is the one to go with. read more ? 23 users found this review helpful helpful?","20 May 2015,"

People should not think of MicroMax. Cons Poor Quality,Worst Quality of App,Your R&D people do not have Brain to test the App like Sales Tracker Service which gives lots of trouble like hanging set Totally MicroMax is better to manufacture Mobile Toys for children. 6 users found this review helpful helpful?","12 Jul 2015,"

Karbonn Titanium Mach Two S360,3 stars,Excellent in LOOKS Overall Decent PERFORMANCE Read this review to knowIF ITS PERFECT FOR YOU?,"I have used a bunch of Karbonn Smartphones in the past also reviewed them here at amazon.Recently i got this smartphone for a review. Upon launch 'Mach Two' was priced near 10k.And due to lack of customer interest,they reduced the price now.So,my review will be basically on the value for money point. It features some good specs and specifically the 8MP camera pair.which we saw in a low end Infocus handset months ago. NOTE: Opinions expressed are solely my own and Unbiased So here's my review, will keep it simple and to the point. DESIGN & Build Quality ------------------------------------- Design wise ,its premium but only in looks.The power ,volume button,sim and MicroSD tray are placed at the right side.Surely the design is inspired from iPhone 5s.And its very light.The front and back are covered with corning gorilla glass,which is only found in premium phones.It guarantees better protection against scratches and all.Its definitely the best looking device you could get at this price. The Build quality is decent,everything in plastic,now a days we see more phones with poly carbonate back.Gorilla glass may be good in some cases,except it may be slippery.So, better invest in a back cover with good grip. DISPLAY QUALITY ------------------------------- Its a 720p display with decent display quality overall.The viewing angles are satisfactory and the color reproduction is to the warm side,which needs to be calibrated from the software side for better viewing experience.The videos and images look good and you may not find anything different from other smartphones in the same range. CAMERA AND SOUND OUTPUT --------------------------------------------------- Most importantly it has 8MP camera pair,which really stands out on paper.But the real life camera performance is to the down side.As far as i have used other phones like redmi 2,moto e and all,they seem to perform much better.Both in images and videos.But still its a lil bit cheaper than both of them.Daylight shots looked good when zoomed out but when viewed at full resolution It looked grainy. Takes a little time to focus and intern its slow.Though the images looked much realistic than some other smartphones(which are over-saturated) . In low light, the camera took images laced with noise and they were mostly unusable. The high resolution front camera is also a below-average performer. Sound output as usual,its good.Karboon is known for making loud speakers.This time they have placed them at the bottom side which actually avoids muffling.But it doesn't mean the quality is premium. Performance and GAMING -------------------------------------- It has the outdated Android v4.4.2 KitKat operating system.Don't think karbonn will be pushing the lollipop update any time soon.The overall performance is satisfactory.It has 1.4GHz octa core processor with 1GB RAM..It may be enough for normal users but The meadiatek 8 core processor fails to provide fluid UI experience.Intern the UI and entire software is bug market.Apps and stuff crashes occasionally if you do some multitasking. Gaming experience is satisfactory.Yes,all low end games like temple run,subway surfer are playable.Can handle some HD games but most of the graphics seemed washed out. Though you may not notice any heating issue,that's common in every other smartphone. BATTERY Backup ---------------------------- The 1.9k mAh battery powers the device pretty decent.You can expect the device to last 7 hours and so on normal usage and 5 and down for heavy usage.You will roughly manage back home with remaining juice. The previous karbonn smartphone performed a little better in terms of battery. Conclusion ,The Tough part --------------------------------------- I can't say to go and buy this phone nor not to buy.Its has its own pros and cons which may or may not be suitable for everyone.If the primary concern is Design and decent camera with normal performance then it will work for you and is a good value for money as per your needs. Though i would recommend to increase your budget to get a far better camera experience. One Last thing ---------------------- Just in case you like my review,then don't forget to hit the 'YES' button below. read more ? 25 users found this review helpful helpful?","24 Sep 2015,"

Karbonn Titanium Mach Two S360,4 stars,Budget iPhone that runs android,"I didn't buy the phone from Flipkart but this is my observation after a week of using this phone. The phone looks fantastic right out of the box. But the USB cable and headphone are made of pretty cheap materials. There is a back case provided with the phone(in the box) and it is pretty decent. But barely any other options for this phone are available in the market in terms of back cases/covers. I am using 2 GSM sims on the phone along with a 16GB memory card. Phone has dual stand by. Call quality is just about ok. Its not loud enough even in full volume, atleast in my opinion. Persons on the other end said they could hear me fine, so MIC works alright i guess. Same observation for loud speaker, just about loud enough. The primary camera(back) functions decently in the outdoors and where there is sufficient light. Same goes for the front camera. But in slightly dim light the performance is very poor. The battery is non removable. It lasted very little on day 1, but i was exploring the phone for long. On day 2 it lasted a full day with moderate usage and the battery performance has remained stable since then. There are no notification lights on this phone. There are speaker ports on both sides at the bottom of the phone but only one side plays music, other side is dummy. The phone comes with a bunch of bloatware. I could not uninstall certain pre-installed apps. And the ones i uninstalled, got re installed automatically. To make things worse, the phone automatically downloaded 2 apps on its own, on day 1. And on day 3 it automatically downloaded 2 games. They just dont go away no matter how many times you uninstall them. Having used it for week now i havent faced any heating issues except for day 1 when i used it a lot. I am only a moderate user btw. For the price i bought(6K), i guess its worth it. The phone is great looking and goes about doing its job. Just dont have too many high expectation from it. read more ? 5 users found this review helpful helpful?","01 Oct 2015,"

Hi-Tech Amaze S3,5 stars,Superb Budget Phone!,"""Highlight: Best Phone for 3,000 INR Look/Feel/Design : White is looking good and the finishing of Phone doesn't look like a 3K phone , it looks quite premium. Decent built quality. Back panel is difficult to remove.The phone look almost similar to its brother, Moto E,. Since the phone is flat we can hold the phone in hand quite easily. Though it seems little heavy. OS / Touch Sensitivity : Android 4.4.2 its silky smooth with this Hardware.Not much lag is observed. Play store load instantaneously. UI response is really good . Speaker : Good sound and it is pretty loud enough. Camera : Flash and NO AUTO FOCUS , don't expect a great pic from this 3K Phone .Average quality picture but quite enough at this price Battery : Good for one day use, whether it's moderate or heavy. Memory : Internal memory available is 2.2 GB after the OS and other files and User available RAM is around 256MB.This is definitely a counter for Micromax, Samsung and Motorola. Pros and Cons ---------------------- Pros 1. Great price 2. 512MBRAM, (4 GB Internal Memory with expandable memory option) 3. 4 inch, HD display at this price. 4. Good Glass protection with flip cover provided 5. Latest version of Android Kit Kat 6. 1500 mAh long lasting battery for a day 7. Good looks & Easy to handle 8. DUAL SIM.. MicroSIM and Macro Sim 9. Most affordable phone yet with 1.2 GHz quadcore processor from this brand 10.Front camera of 1.3 megapixels Cons 1. No auto focus, average clarity picture from a 5MP 2.No notification light ( this is adjustable) 3. Headset. ( It's like I bought some Chinese headset wroth 100-150 INR :\ ) But a worth phone set yet at this price so buy with confidence"" read more ? 2 users found this review helpful helpful?","01 Apr 2015,"

Lava Iris 325 Style,4 stars,Pretty Nice!,If you are looking for a phone under Rs.3000 then Lava Iris 325 Style is your best bet.

Lava Iris 325 Style,4 stars,Affordable Phone !,"I went for Lava Iris 325 Style as I couldn t afford to go for a high priced phone after I broke my old one. I was in for a surprise after I bought this phone. With its 1.3Ghz dual core processor it runs smoother than I had expected, though the RAM could have been better. Its 2MP rear camera works as you would expect it to. The battery backup is not bad if we consider the price. Overall it s not a bad phone considering the price. 0 users found this review helpful helpful?","21 May 2015,"

Karbonn Platinum P9,5 stars,Best Phablet in this Range,"Recently I bought this phone @ Rs 8500 online, here is the quick review of this product. DESIGN & SCREEN Pros : It is one of the best phone designed by karbonn.8.5mm slimmer & a flip cover with this phone give this phone a premium look. It is the first 6""inch smartphone by karbonn& the first phone under the Platinum series.The screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Cons: It is having QHD 960x540 &296ppi though we expect more in this price range. Though it has good viewing angle & screen is bright in sunlight & even the 1080p videos plays smoothly without any lag. CAMERA The phone is having 8MP front & back which is able to click decent photos even in poor light..the color reproduction is natural, few detailing is missing but it is OK.. Cons: The phone record video in 720p (Karbonn low budget phones like Sparkle V & Mach One record video in 1080p) SOFTWARE The phone is running on Kitkat 4.4. and as Karbonn promises it will be upgraded to lollipop in future. The phone has smooth user interface. karbonn has experimented on app icons . HARDWARE It is where this phone lag behind. Karbonn is using the same MediaTek chipset in 5000 to 8000 price range. It is running on 1.3GHz Quad core processor & only 1GB RAM(should be atleast 2GB). But instead of that this phone perform better than other device with same chipset. It scores approx 21000 score in AnTuTu Benchmark which enough to handle heavy games,,It also have 16GB of inbuilt memory which is too much for any user 9GB is availabe for User we can also expand it to 32GB BATTERY & VIDEO PLAYBACK This phone battery run whole day after heavy usage. This phone gives a video playback of 4hrs GAMING & HEATING ISSUE I tried to run few games like Asphalt 8 & Fifa 15 both run smoothly with no frame drop. Few heating issues are found but not like other phone which heated up like a heater in which u can make a chapati. Verdict So at last i must it is the best 6"" phone under 10000. as only micromax doodle 4 & Karbonn Platinum P9 is the only 6"" smartphone under 10000. & between these two Karbonn perform much better in term of Camera & hardware performance.. If u want smaller screen with better performance Lenevo A6000plus & A6000/ Karbonn Octane & Micromax Canvus Nitro are some better smartphone in 8000 price range read more ? 7 users found this review helpful helpful?","30 May 2015,"

Zen Ultrafone 402 Play,5 stars,good product,"for regular use it can great one.great mobile phone introduced,everything is right about this smart phone.Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands 0 users found this review helpful helpful?","27 Feb 2015,"

Blackberry Leap,5 stars,best phone i ever used but a little over priced bt its worthy,"i bought this cell a week back as i was impressed by my cousins z3 working condition :) i was a android user nd as days passed by i was fed up of android. so decided to buy a blackberry brand :) at first this phone was weird u no :) later wen utry to understand the phone through the user guide which the phone itself provides u its very amazing :) its purely classic nd standard :) this cell is the best cell i hade till date :) its has a beautiful body which is nt slippery it cums with a hard rubber may b kind of finish :) the processor is kinda bit old but its too good under this phone :) no even a single second of lag :) to b frank i regret fr now switching into blackberry in the earlier days thinking that blackberry sucks :) this a good set but ya its may b over rated a bit but its awesome, the link below proves the worth of it :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oLT9lHaxco 18 users found this review helpful helpful?","25 May 2015,"
Blackberry Leap,5 stars,The Best Among All,"I am Blackberry fan from very long time. Since the time i was using these phones they are giving excellent efforts in productivity.So from OS 7 to this 10.3 OS there is an another proof of innovation in operating system strategy. let we decide criteria before buying it, suppose if you are a childish user of phone that's have a lot of free time in a day and having fond of playing gaming , installing jokes , themes etc. like apps usually then BLACKBERRY is not for you, But if you are a real SMARTPHONE USER then BLACKBERRY has the capacity to fulfill all of your professional and business needs. Go for it, it will be a ''BRAND IN YOUR HAND''. 15 users found this review helpful helpful?","29 May 2015,"
Blackberry Leap,5 stars,The Best Mid Range Phone,"In todays world of madly comparing specs of the Hardware, here is one phone which stands out.Even though the critics pan this phone for its older specs after more than one weeks usage i can confirm that this phone works beautifully for the voice and mails.there is no lacking in its performance. There is clarity in the calls and the great blackberry mail.Why people talk about the apps which always collects more permissions than required and compromising the security of our data i do not know. Overall one of the most value for device you can find in the market.( ignore the so called expert reviewers view that you can get higher configuration hardware at this price. 8 users found this review helpful helpful?","07 Jun 2015,"

Intex Aqua N7,1 stars,What a waste of money,"I bought this phone by paying 4299 rs. I bought this phone because of 8 MP camera , though i compromised with 512 MB RAM but this intex aqua N7 8MP camera is worse than normal 3.2 MP camera. The day I got this phone I requested for refund , 2 times they have rejected my request and again I requested for refund but still I am waiting when they call me back. Very poor response from them. Never buy a product using flipkart platform. And this phone is just waste of money, even karbon phone is better than this. And finally they refused to refund, very poor response from flipkart. 9 users found this review helpful helpful?","30 Mar 2015,"
